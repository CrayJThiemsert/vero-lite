# PLAN-0091: Narrative→Vertical Scaffolder Tool v1 — `vero-lite scaffold` (the create shape)

**Status:** **COMPLETE** — 10/10 ACs met, closed out + archived session 168 (2026-07-23).
Built as seven PRs in s167 (#873–#879) and completed by four more in s168 (#883–#885, plus
#884's CLI wiring); `main` = `c2b92c5`, full suite 3109 passed / 7 skipped on the merge commit.
SD-1…SD-5 were all Cray-ratified (typed, AskUserQuestion), as was the s168 ruling to BUILD the
two partial ACs rather than re-scope them. See **Closeout — session 168** at the end.

## Goal

Build the tool PLAN-0086 forward-declared as "the scaffolder TOOL itself — the next
PLAN (L-A)" (`docs/plans/done/0086-fleet-vertical-timed-manual-scaffold.md:411-413`):
a `vero-lite scaffold` CLI command that turns a customer's spoken operational
narrative into a **running governed vertical package** — intake → ontology YAML →
the shipped codegen floor → the vertical package → the AT-2 money spine → the four
external wires — with **every governance value entering through a human-confirmed,
typed intake record, never through the LLM**, and with a hard, designed-in ceiling:
the tool **detects, STOPS, and hands a pre-built argument to a human** at every
governance tripwire; it never clears one.

Spec inputs: the 14-row manual-seam ledger and the 4-question customer-intake log
from PLAN-0086 (gitignored:
`docs/research/private/2026-07-21-fleet-scaffold-seam-ledger.md`,
`docs/research/private/2026-07-21-fleet-scaffold-question-log.md`). PLAN-0086 `:157`
declares the ledger "**IS the scaffolder tool's spec**"; this PLAN reads the ledger
**as corrected** by the four verified drift corrections in § Drift corrections —
two ledger rows are now wrong on disk.

**Strategic classification (stated once):** this is **shape-1 wedge work** under
ADR-0032 D1 element 2 ("Guess in their shape, on the shipped machinery… Every
guessed value is marked 'guess — correct me'", `docs/adr/0032-…md:127-131`). It is
not shape-2/shape-3 work, so ADR-0032 D2's binding pilot gate (`0032:161-167`) does
not apply. The tool's purpose is to make the wedge motion — pre-build a *guessed*
governed hero in the partner's own shape — fast, repeatable, and performable by
someone who is not the founder.

## Why build a tool against a 16–28-minute manual baseline (the honest counter-argument)

The manual path is already fast: PLAN-0086 built a whole new vertical in **27m39s
hands-on** (`0086:535`), PLAN-0089 added a calm path in **~14 min hands-on**
(`0089:435`), PLAN-0090 added a scheduled variant in **16m13s hands-on**
(`0090:506`). A reviewer should ask why an L-effort tool beats that.

The answer, with its caveat intact — **binding, per ADR-0032 D5 and PLAN-0086's own
AC-7 honesty clause**: every one of those numbers is a **lower bound measured under
maximally favourable conditions** — the same operator who built the donor path, a
shipped donor to copy, all machinery already shipped, and every governance decision
pre-ratified by Cray *before* the clock started. None of them measures blind intake
from a real narrative, a fresh operator, or machinery construction. **The three
numbers are companions, never addends — never present them summed.**

What the tool actually buys, grounded in the measurements rather than asserted:

1. **The intake round-trips add ~16% on top of the run, and they are additive —
   not a slice of the hands-on number.** *(Corrected at Code R2; the session-164
   dispatch stated this as "6m51s of 27m39s ≈ 25%", which was wrong twice over.
   The error was the dispatch's, not the drafter's.)* The question log's
   interruption ledger totals **6m51s**, of which **5m17s was fully-blocked idle**
   (3m07s awaiting Q1 + 2m10s awaiting Q2–Q4); the remaining 1m34s was spent asking
   Q1–Q4 while work **continued** on the ฿-independent files ("resumed on the
   ฿-independent files rather than idling"). Critically, **none of it is inside the
   27m39s**: every phase row in PLAN-0086's table has `wall == hands-on`
   (`0086:523-535`) and the rows sum to 27m38s, so all interruption time sits in the
   43m17s − 27m39s = **15m39s of wall that hands-on excludes**. The honest read:
   intake round-trips cost **6m51s of 43m17s wall (~16%)**, blocking work for
   **5m17s (~12% of wall)**. A tool cannot delete customer-answer latency, but it can
   (a) derive the *complete* question set up front instead of discovering gaps
   mid-file, (b) enforce the re-ask discipline the human demonstrably fumbled (Q2's
   accountability half was silently dropped), and (c) batch the asks into one
   customer-shaped pass — which attacks the 5m17s blocked half directly.
2. **The money spine's three parse round-trips go to zero.** `procedures.yaml` cost
   4m41s — more than the other seven files combined — and failed to load 3× on
   ADR-0025 D4 (currency in free text). The lint that rejects that is already
   shipped (`services/engine/procedures/prose_lint.py:133` currency scan, `:217`
   the ADR-0025 D4 canonical-text scan); the tool runs it **pre-emit** instead of
   eating load-time failures one field at a time.
3. **The operator stops being the founder.** The 27m39s belongs to the person who
   built the machinery. The tool encodes the checklist, the wire points (all
   **four** — one of which did not exist when the ledger was written, see
   correction 2), and the tripwire map, so a non-founder operator inherits them
   instead of rediscovering them. This is the wedge's repeatability requirement,
   not a speed requirement.
4. **Five of six verticals shipped with a latent daemon-crash wire bug** until
   PLAN-0090 fixed it (the second registrar map). A generator that writes both
   maps by construction converts a recurring human omission class into a
   structural impossibility.

## Grounding — what is already shipped (verified on `main=caeda74`; invoke, never re-implement)

| Shipped thing | Where (file:line) | This PLAN's relation to it |
|---|---|---|
| Narrative→procedure pipeline S0–S6 (classify LLM → abstain → instantiate → stub-stamp → prose LLM → assemble) | `services/engine/procedures/generator/pipeline.py` (PLAN-0040, under Accepted ADR-0024) | **Reuse.** No second pipeline. |
| Archetype template artifact + registry — **AT-1 family only today** | `services/engine/procedures/archetypes/template.py:108` (`ArchetypeTemplate`), `:254` (`REGISTRY = {AT-1, AT-1b, AT-3}`) | **Extend** with one AT-2 template (Step 4; lineage in § Drift corrections). |
| Restricted draft types + governance-field disjointness | `services/engine/procedures/draft.py:123` (`StepDraft`), `:171` (`ProcedureDraft`), `:186` (`GovernanceStub`), `:109-115` (`GOVERNANCE_FIELDS` union incl. `:98` `VERTICAL_GOVERNANCE_FIELDS = {compliance_criteria}`) | **Reuse.** The LLM emission surface stays exactly this. |
| Deterministic prose-lint (numerics / currency / handler names / approval verbs) | `services/engine/procedures/prose_lint.py:133`, `:217` | **Reuse pre-emit** (Step 4). |
| API exposure of the generator | `services/api/routers/procedure_draft.py:62-70` | **Untouched.** The CLI path does not alter the router or its abstain behaviour. |
| AT-2 abstain guard in the API pipeline | `services/engine/procedures/generator/pipeline.py:82` (`_AT2_ONLY_KINDS`), `:190` | **Untouched — guaranteed by the ratified SD-5 (a).** The classify catalog is built from `REGISTRY.values()` (`:225`) and the label route resolves through the same dict (`:253`/`:258`), so *central* registration would change this path whether or not the tool called it. (a) keeps the AT-2 template out of `REGISTRY` entirely, so this path is byte-unchanged. |
| Codegen floor: ontology YAML → 7 artifacts, EXIT 0, 2m02s measured | `uv run vero-lite validate` / `generate` (console script `pyproject.toml:44-45`) | **Invoke** (ledger row 10: `[one-time-only]` — the floor, never re-implemented). |
| Tier-1 Mirror scaffolder | `services/engine/scaffold.py:876` (`scaffold_vertical`), CLI seam "Requires the ontology … to exist first" (`services/engine/cli.py:84-85`) | **Untouched as a command** (ADR-0015 D2 stays); internals reused where they fit. The new tool starts *before* the ontology exists — exactly the seam `new-vertical` starts after. |
| Per-vertical declared criterion vocabulary (no engine enum) | `services/engine/procedures/spec.py:876-884` (RETIRED note), `:1688` (`compliance_criteria`), `:1717` (`_validate_compliance_criteria`) | **Rely on.** A new AT-2 vertical ships with **zero engine diff** (correction 1). |
| The two executor-registrar maps, pinned EQUAL | `services/api/main.py:141`, `services/engine/cli.py:130` (mirror rationale `:123-129`), equality pin `tests/services/engine/test_cli_registrars.py` | **Write BOTH** (Step 5; correction 2). |
| Archetype label map + procedure census | `services/api/routers/procedures.py:50` (`PROCEDURE_ARCHETYPES`), `tests/api/test_procedures_endpoint.py:40` (`_EXPECTED`), `:151` (`total == 13`) | **Write** the mechanical entries (ledger rows 8–9). |
| AT-2 signature census — **armed for a 5th signature** | `tests/services/engine/procedures/test_at2_signature_retrigger.py:167-205` (`_BASELINE_SIGNATURES`), `:307-319` (set-equality), `:322-342` (obligation-owned guard) | **Never edit the baseline.** Predict + STOP + hand over (Step 6). |
| Committed golden donor: the hand-built fleet vertical | `verticals/fleet_maintenance/` (8-file package + 4 wires) | **The diff-oracle.** PLAN-0086 SD-1(a) committed it *precisely so this PLAN could diff generated output against it* (`0086:186-188`). |

## Drift corrections absorbed (dispatch §3, re-verified by the drafter on disk)

The seam ledger was written 2026-07-21; the tree moved. This PLAN is drafted against
the corrected facts, so it cannot be read against the stale rows:

1. **Ledger row 12 is dead.** The `ComplianceCriterion` engine enum is retired
   (`spec.py:876-884`); the vocabulary is declared per vertical
   (`spec.py:1688`, validated at `:1717`). Consequence built into Step 4: the
   scaffolded vertical **declares its own criterion vocabulary in its
   `procedures.yaml` and touches zero engine code.** No design element of this PLAN
   may assume an "engine edit per vertical" seam.
2. **The hand-wire count is 4, not 3.** PLAN-0090 added the mirror registrar map
   `services/engine/cli.py:130`, deliberately **mirroring, never importing**
   `services/api/main.py:141` (`cli.py:123-129`), with the two sets pinned equal by
   `tests/services/engine/test_cli_registrars.py`. Step 5 writes **both maps**;
   AC-6 makes the equality pin the oracle. (The bug class is real: five of six
   verticals had the daemon-crash omission until PLAN-0090.)
3. **Cite the ledger, never the PLAN-0086 closeout summary.** The closeout
   (`0086:539-545`) says "`[scaffolder-can-generate]`: 6" then enumerates seven
   items (6+5+2 = 13 ≠ 14). The correct tally from the ledger rows:
   **7** `[scaffolder-can-generate]` (rows 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9) ·
   **5** `[needs-human-judgment]` (rows 2, 6, 11, 13, 14) ·
   **2** `[one-time-only]` (rows 10, 12) = **14**.
4. **Row 13's example is spent; its lesson is armed.** The N=4 census firing
   self-cancelled the deferral (below) — but the set-equality assertion
   (`test_at2_signature_retrigger.py:307-319`) **remains armed and goes RED on any
   fifth distinct signature**, with "Re-argue it (do not just update this list)"
   written into the assertion. Step 6 is designed to that lesson: detect → STOP →
   hand the human a pre-built comparison table.

**Deferral lineage (why emitting an AT-2 spine is in bounds).** ADR-0024 D7 /
PLAN-0040 LOCKED-7 (`0040:38`) deferred AT-2 generation on Rule-of-Three at N=1.
That deferral (operationalized as the ADR-0025 D7 marker) **was CANCELLED at N=4 —
Cray, typed, 2026-07-21** — recorded durably in the committed marker module
(`test_at2_signature_retrigger.py:76-108`) and in `spec.py:876-884`. Under CLAUDE.md
§1 precedence the newest ratified decision wins: AT-2 emission is no longer barred
on the old ground. Two additional facts make it *safe* now, not merely permitted:
(a) ADR-0024 OQ-8's stated **precondition** for any future AT-2 generation — "a
typed, human-only sub-model for scored-rule / compliance-criteria / DOA-tier
content" — is **MET on disk**: `DoaLadder` / `ScoredRule` / `ComplianceGate` are
typed `governance_content` models, H-class-guarded ("never model-emitted",
`spec.py:872-873`; `draft.py:109-115`); (b) the cancellation resolution steered the
paid extraction at "stop requiring an engine edit per vertical" (landed, PLAN-0087)
— and this PLAN's AT-2 emission is exactly the **structure-only** kind ledger row 11
calls mechanical, with all values human-supplied. The remaining extraction half (the
procedure-aware `ExecutorFactory`) stays owned by **PLAN-0076 Step T1** — this PLAN
does not touch it (see Out of Scope).

## Deliverable shape

A new **Typer subcommand `vero-lite scaffold`** on the existing console script
(`vero-lite = "services.engine.cli:app"`, `pyproject.toml:44-45`; existing commands
`validate` / `generate` / `new-vertical` / `scheduler`), implemented in a new
engine-generic package **`services/engine/scaffolder/`** (placement mirrors the
ADR-0024 OQ-2 reasoning that put `archetypes/` under `services/engine/procedures/`:
the tool is vertical-agnostic engine machinery, not per-vertical config).

- **CLI, not a router, in v1.** The operator is the FDE-style human running intake,
  not the customer; the review surface for generated *procedures* remains the
  PLAN-0039/0040 component (ADR-0024 D8) and the intake UI face (D9) is a
  follow-on, not v1 (see Out of Scope).
- `vero-lite new-vertical` is **not** overloaded: it stays the ADR-0015 D2 Tier-1
  Mirror vehicle (PLAN-0086 `:413` explicitly banned it for this motion). The new
  command covers the seam `new-vertical` declares out of scope — it starts from a
  narrative, *before* the ontology exists (`cli.py:84-85`).
- Inputs: `--narrative <file>` (free text) and/or `--intake <file>` (a typed,
  partially- or fully-answered intake record); output: a new `verticals/<ns>/`
  package + proposed wire edits, **uncommitted**, refusing to overwrite an existing
  namespace. No git operations, ever.

**The ADR-0024 compliance story, stated once and designed to (binding):** the LLM's
emission surface in this tool is *unchanged* from the shipped pipeline — draft-typed
structure + closed-enum classification + advisory prose behind `prose_lint`. Every
governance **value** (฿ tiers, roles, waiver content, criterion ids, thresholds,
synthetic-fixture numbers) enters through the **typed `IntakeRecord`, whose value
slots are operator-input-only by construction** — the LLM has no write path to
them. The deterministic emitters move human-typed values from the intake record
into H-class fields; an unanswered H-slot is emitted as the stub sentinel +
`governance_todo` entry, leaving the spine **draft-loadable but not run-loadable**
(ADR-0024 D6). "Governed ≠ generated" therefore stays a type-level property
(`0024:74-78`), not a prompt hope, on this new surface.

## Acceptance Criteria

All ACs are **offline-verifiable** (CLAUDE.md §8: the offline oracle is the gate).
Every LLM-touching stage runs behind recorded fixtures in tests; MS-S1 is never
required for any AC. A single live smoke is *evidence only*, Cray-gated — see
§ Verification for what it would catch that fixtures cannot.

- [x] **AC-1 — the command exists and is inert-safe.** `vero-lite scaffold` is
  registered on the existing app (`pyproject.toml:44-45`); `--help` and a dry-run
  (`--plan-only`: print the derived question queue + file manifest, write nothing)
  work offline with deterministic exit codes; the command **refuses to run** if
  `verticals/<ns>/` already exists (no overwrite path in v1). Verified via the CLI
  test runner.
- [x] **AC-2 — intake derives the complete question set up front, with mechanical
  re-ask discipline.** A typed `IntakeRecord` + a deterministic **required-slot
  checklist** derived from (the AT-2 template's obligation set × the ontology's
  three judgment slots × the synthetic-fixture value slots). On a committed
  fleet-*shaped* narrative fixture (same four gap classes as PLAN-0086's run:
  feel-only authority tiers, an unbounded emergency bypass, an ambiguous requester,
  a threshold-less comparison rule — deliberately **not** the verbatim private
  narrative, which stays gitignored for future-run freshness), the derived open
  queue covers all four gap classes. **The Q2 test, named:** answering only
  "cap = ฿10,000" to the emergency-waiver question fills exactly the cap sub-slot;
  the ratifier and window sub-slots remain **individually open** and re-surface.
  One number is never treated as a full answer.
- [x] **AC-3 — ontology emission is mechanical where the ledger says it is, and
  refuses to guess where it says judgment lives.** The emitter produces the 6-object
  OCT skeleton + all 7 link_types from the grammar alone; the three judgment slots
  (Asset noun · per-entity band property · `RecommendedAction.action_type`
  vocabulary) and narrative-mined property enums are emitted **only from confirmed
  intake entries** — unconfirmed ⇒ the run stops at the ontology stage with the
  open queue printed, it does not default. The emitted YAML passes the invoked
  floor: `vero-lite validate` + `generate` EXIT 0 into a scratch tree (row 10:
  invoked, never re-implemented).
- [x] **AC-4 — package emission with no fabricated numbers.** Rows 1/3/4/5 files are
  emitted from the ontology (`__init__.py`, `handlers.py` with
  `ACTION_TYPES` == the ontology enum + registrar-name convention,
  `data_adapter/__init__.py`, `procedures_factory.py` incl.
  `advisory_builder=GateAdvisoryBuilder()` and StepKind slots computed from the
  spine), plus the `synthetic.py` skeleton (row 6) where **every numeric literal
  either traces to an intake answer or carries a `# GUESS — รอแก้` marker** —
  asserted by a scanner test, so "must not fabricate; ask" is falsifiable, not
  aspirational. Event emission honours latest-per-asset ordering semantics (row 6).
  The README (row 14) is emitted with the mechanical parts (env block, step
  walk-through) generated and the human parts (problem statement, the
  **"stated but NOT enforced" register** — fed by the intake queue's unanswered
  non-schema sub-slots, e.g. Q2's ratifier/window) clearly stubbed.

  **CLOSEOUT CORRECTION (session 168, #883) — this box was ticked while the AC was
  not met.** The text above requires `procedures_factory.py` "incl.
  `advisory_builder=GateAdvisoryBuilder()` and StepKind slots computed from the spine";
  neither `procedures_factory` nor `GateAdvisoryBuilder` appeared anywhere under
  `services/engine/scaffolder/` at s167 close. The gap was recorded only under AC-7(b),
  so the s167 count of "8/10" was really 7/10. Classified **`was an error`**, not
  `superseded by new info` — the AC text never changed, so this is not evolution.
  #883 makes it true: the factory is emitted with the named kwarg, and its StepKind
  slots are DERIVED from the row-11 spine (`factory_step_kinds`) rather than hardcoded,
  with a test asserting the derivation rather than the answer.
- [x] **AC-5 — the money spine, structure generated, values human, lint pre-paid.**
  An AT-2 `ArchetypeTemplate` exists (Step 4) modelling row 11's fixed spine
  (intake → judge → reshape → rule_gate → approve → fulfill + SoD + terminal); the
  emitted `procedures.yaml` round-trips `load_procedures`; its gate signature
  matches the template (ADR-0024 D4 agreement — a contradicting `gate_kind` is a
  hard failure); the vertical **declares its own `compliance_criteria`**
  (`spec.py:1688`) with **zero engine diff** (correction 1); every governance value
  traces to a confirmed intake answer, else the stub sentinel + `governance_todo`
  (draft-loadable, refused by `validate_runnable` — D6); and the emitter runs the
  shipped free-text lint (`prose_lint.py:133/:217`) **before** writing, so the
  golden fixture emits with **zero** ADR-0025 D4 parse round-trips (the manual run
  ate three).
- [x] **AC-6 — all four wires, by construction.** The wire-writer produces the
  registrar wrapper + entry in `services/api/main.py:141` **and** the mirror entry
  in `services/engine/cli.py:130` (lazy-import convention preserved — row 7), the
  `PROCEDURE_ARCHETYPES` entry (`procedures.py:50`, classified from gate content,
  row 8), and the census updates (`test_procedures_endpoint.py:40` `_EXPECTED` +
  the `total ==` pin, row 9). Oracle: with the scaffolded vertical present, the
  existing equality pin `tests/services/engine/test_cli_registrars.py` and the
  procedures-endpoint census both go GREEN — the same tests that hard-fail on a
  missed wire today.
- [x] **AC-7 — the golden diff-oracle: regenerate fleet.** From a committed, typed
  intake fixture carrying the Q1–Q4 answers + the three ontology judgments (the
  answers are in-tree facts already: the ladder `[0,5k)/[5k,50k)/[50k,∞)`, waiver
  cap ฿10k relaxing `three_bid`, requester=ช่างใหญ่ with approve-down (PLAN-0075
  Policy B), `three_quote` ≥ ฿20k × 3 vendors), the tool regenerates the fleet
  package into a scratch tree and it **structurally matches** committed
  `verticals/fleet_maintenance/`: same file set; same ontology object/link/
  property-enum sets incl. the band property on the Asset; `ACTION_TYPES` set
  equal; spine gate signature equal to the shipped one
  (`("rule_gate", ("three_quote",)), ("doa_tier", ("THB",))` — the
  `_BASELINE_SIGNATURES` fleet row); governance values equal to the Q1–Q4 answers;
  wire entries equal to the in-tree ones. Byte-equality is asserted **only** where
  the ledger claims it (row 4: `data_adapter/__init__.py` modulo namespace) —
  prose may differ, structure may not.
  **CLOSEOUT — PARTIAL (session 167).** Asserted and green (`tests/services/engine/scaffolder/test_golden_e2e.py`): the ontology object SET and link_type SET, the band property on the Asset, the `ACTION_TYPES` set, the spine gate signature equal to the shipped baseline row, the governance values against the recorded Q1-Q4 answers, and the wire entries; the set assertions were PROBED non-vacuous (swapping the asset noun to `Lorry` diverges both sets). **NOT met, and named rather than papered over:** (a) the donor's narrative-mined per-object properties (`truck_class`, `odometer_km`, `plate`, `depot_type`) are not emitted — mining them from free text is the LLM surface this PLAN deliberately keeps OUT of the value path, so this may be a scope correction rather than a gap; (b) `procedures_factory.py` is not emitted, so the file-set assertion excludes it BY NAME; (c) the row-4 byte-equality (`data_adapter/__init__.py` modulo namespace) was not asserted.

  **CLOSEOUT — MET (session 168, #883).** All three remainders closed, and closing them
  surfaced that the framing above understated the problem: (b) was not a file-set
  bookkeeping gap — **the emitted package could not load**. `wire.py` registered
  `verticals.<ns>.procedures_factory`, a module `emit_package` never wrote; and the emitted
  adapter's registrar called `registry.register_adapter` with **two** arguments against a
  one-argument signature, so a scaffolded vertical raised `TypeError` the moment anything
  imported it. Nothing caught either, because the package tests only `ast.parse` the emitted
  text. (a) is closed the way it had to be: the donor's domain columns now enter through
  **operator-typed intake slots** (`ontology.asset_properties` / `site_properties` /
  `asset_title_key`, `SlotKind.ONTOLOGY_DOMAIN`), not narrative mining — mining would put the
  model back on the value path and trip SD-1's promotion tripwire. Stated honestly: supplying
  the donor's own columns as answers makes the property-set assertion a test of the emitter's
  PLUMBING, not evidence the tool *derived* the schema. (c) is asserted as STRUCTURAL equality
  modulo namespace rather than literal bytes, and that is a correction rather than a
  weakening: the donor's docstring records that it was "Hand-written … NOT `vero-lite
  new-vertical`", so a tool emitting those bytes would emit a **false provenance claim about
  its own output**. The AC's own "prose may differ, structure may not" is the reading that
  survives. Non-vacuity probed twice (one changed default reddens the row-4 oracle; restoring
  the two-argument call reddens both new guards with `TypeError: too many positional
  arguments`), restored from `/tmp` and verified `cmp -s` byte-identical.
- [x] **AC-8 — the governance ceiling, exercised not asserted.** The tool computes
  the would-be AT-2 signature of the spine it is about to emit using **the same
  fingerprint key** as the census (Step 6 extracts the key helpers so the two
  cannot drift), compares against the shipped baseline, and — since any new
  AT-2-bearing vertical **is** a candidate 5th signature — **STOPS before writing
  any wire edit**, emitting a pre-built comparison table (new signature vs each
  `_BASELINE_SIGNATURES` row, per-axis deltas: gate composition / authority
  quantity / enum surface) that names the exact test that will go RED and quotes
  its own instruction ("Re-argue it — do not just update this list"). The tool
  **never modifies `_BASELINE_SIGNATURES`** and has no flag that does. Offline
  test: a synthetic would-be-5th-signature intake ⇒ stop + table + zero writes to
  `tests/`; the fleet golden fixture (a baseline member) passes through without
  firing.
- [x] **AC-9 — hard non-capabilities hold.** Test-asserted where mechanically
  possible, review-asserted otherwise: zero git operations; zero procedure-run
  firing; zero writes to any **existing** `verticals/*/procedures.yaml`
  (ADR-0024 `:147`); the full AC suite passes with MS-S1 unreachable.
- [x] **AC-10 — counted prose is disposed per SD-4's ratified option** in the files
  this tool's wire-writer touches. **Scope corrected session 166 — cite the whole
  counted narrative, not one line of it:** the module docstring's per-vertical tally
  runs `tests/api/test_procedures_endpoint.py:5-9` (**not** `:5-6`), the test docstring
  tally runs `:115-120`, the inline comment runs `:144-150`, plus the `main.py`
  registrar-module docstring count (`main.py:149-155`, ledger rows 7/9). **One of these
  is stale on disk today, and it is not the one SD-4 named:** `:8` reads
  "fleet_maintenance ships **two**" while `_EXPECTED` ships **three** (`:63-77` —
  `governed_repair_approval`, `pm_service_round`, `scheduled_pm_service_round`; the
  PLAN-0090 twin is missing from the prose) and the sibling docstring at `:119` already
  says "three". The narrative therefore sums to **12** against the executable
  `assert total == 13` (`:151`) — arithmetic proof of the drift, and precisely SD-4's
  point that only the assertion cannot go silently stale. The token "six" at `:5` is
  **correct** (six keys in `_EXPECTED`). Disposing these four sites, no further stale
  count is reachable along the tool's write path.

  **CLOSEOUT — PARTIAL (session 167).** The SD-4 disposition is implemented and green (`dispose_counted_prose`, idempotent, with the executable `assert total ==` pin bumped instead of the prose being recounted) and it caught a real stale tally the single-space pattern had missed. **NOT met:** the wire-writer applies the disposition only to `tests/api/test_procedures_endpoint.py`. The fourth counted site named by this AC — the `services/api/main.py` registrar-module docstring count — is left untouched.

  **CLOSEOUT — MET (session 168, #885).** The remainder was not "add main.py to the targets
  dict": doing only that would have been a **no-op**. The shipped pattern matches
  `<vertical> ships <numberword>` — a PER-MEMBER tally — and scores **zero** on *"All six
  PROCEDURE-SHIPPING verticals register a factory"*, which counts the COLLECTION. Same rule,
  different shape. The same blind spot hid a third site inside the file already being
  disposed (*"across six verticals"*), so the s167 note "applies only to
  `test_procedures_endpoint.py`" understated it: within that file one of the three named
  sites was untouched too. `_COUNTED_COLLECTION` now deletes the cardinal, and `main.py`
  joins the disposition path.

  **One site is reported, not rewritten — deliberately, and asserted as such.** The census
  comment at `:144-150` carries four interlocking counts in one free-form narrative, each
  encoding which PLAN contributed which procedure. A regex rewriting that would either mangle
  the grammar or delete the provenance, and **deleting a shipped file's history to satisfy a
  tally rule is a worse outcome than the stale tally**. `residual_counted_prose` surfaces it
  for a human — the same stance the tool takes at a governance tripwire: detect, hand a human
  the specifics, never clear it yourself. That is the difference between a known gap and a
  silent one.

  The oracle could not have caught any of this: `assert replaced >= 1` was satisfied by the
  per-member tallies alone. It is now per-shape, plus a test that the WIRE-WRITER applies the
  disposition to `main.py` rather than merely that the function can — those two were separate
  for a whole PLAN, which is how the gap survived.

## Out of Scope

- ❌ **Auto-commit / any git operation.** Output is uncommitted working-tree files;
  Code commits via PR (ADR-009 D2). Also no write-back into any **existing**
  `verticals/*/procedures.yaml` (ADR-0024 `:147`).
- ❌ **Firing a run of the scaffolded procedure.** No run (ADR-0024 D10). The live
  boot→fire→park walk stays a human demo step; one live smoke is evidence only,
  Cray-gated (CLAUDE.md §8).
- ❌ **The extend shapes** — calm-path (PLAN-0089) and scheduled-variant (PLAN-0090)
  scaffolding — per SD-2's recommendation. Their seams have no ledger; they are
  this tool's v2 once their own seam evidence exists.
- ❌ **The intake UI face / edit-mode review surface** (ADR-0024 D8/D9, PLAN-0017
  face). v1 is CLI-first; the API generator path (`procedure_draft.py:62-70`) and
  its AT-2 abstain guard (`pipeline.py:82`) are untouched.
- ❌ **The procedure-aware `ExecutorFactory` extraction** — owned by PLAN-0076
  Step T1 (`test_at2_signature_retrigger.py:322-342` guards that ownership). The
  tool writes today's two registrar maps as they exist; if T1 lands, Step 5's
  wire-writer simplifies in T1's PLAN, not here.
- ❌ **Anything shape-2** (self-improvement loop) — ADR-0032 D2's pilot gate stands;
  this PLAN neither needs nor claims the named escape.
- ❌ **dbt/SQLMesh auto-canonicalization** — a funded Phase-2 deliverable per
  ADR-0032, never a pilot precondition. Scaffolded verticals are synthetic
  in-memory (building_materials/fleet pattern): **no ORM, no Alembic**.
- ❌ **Clearing any governance tripwire** — editing `_BASELINE_SIGNATURES`, the
  census totals beyond the mechanical row-9 entries, or any G1/G2-adjacent
  artifact. Detect → STOP → hand over is the ceiling (ledger row 13), and it is a
  feature of the design, not a gap.
- ❌ **Replacing `vero-lite new-vertical`** (ADR-0015 D2 stays as-is) and any
  multi-narrative / multi-procedure batch mode (mirrors ADR-0024 OQ-6:
  one-vertical-per-run).

## Surfaced decisions (SD-1…SD-4 — **RATIFIED by Cray 2026-07-22, session 165, typed AskUserQuestion — all four as-recommended**; **SD-5 RATIFIED (a)** by Cray 2026-07-23, session 166, typed — also as-recommended. **All five closed; nothing in this PLAN awaits a decision.**)

### SD-1 — Does the narrative→ontology-YAML stage need its own ADR?

**Question:** ADR-0024 deliberately scoped itself to procedures and left the
ADR-008 ontology codegen path untouched (`0024:6`). The tool's ontology stage is
new authoring surface: mechanical skeleton (6 objects, 7 link_types) + exactly
three concentrated human judgments (ledger row 2) + LLM-*proposed*,
human-ratified enum values (action vocabulary, property enums).
**Options:** (a) a new ADR; (b) an ADR-0024 amendment; (c) a PLAN-level design
decision, no ADR.
**Recommendation: (c), with a named promotion tripwire.** Reasoning: an ADR is
warranted when a new *invariant class* or cross-cutting contract is created. This
stage creates none — it binds itself to already-Accepted invariants: closed-grammar
skeleton emission is deterministic code; the three judgment slots are
human-confirmed inputs (the ADR-0021 classify/propose-then-human-ratify pattern,
already Accepted); values are H-class (ADR-0024 D3, extended by analogy but
enforced by the same shipped machinery). (b) is the worst option — ADR-0024's clean
self-scoping (`:6`) is load-bearing and amending it to cover ontology muddies a
ratified boundary. **The tripwire that flips this to (a):** if the build finds the
ontology stage needs the LLM to emit *structure* beyond the fixed 6-object grammar
(new object types, new link shapes) or any unratified vocabulary to land without a
human confirm, STOP — that is a new authoring invariant and gets its own ADR before
the stage ships. What makes this Cray's call: it sets where the governance-artifact
boundary sits for all future authoring surfaces, not just this one.

**RATIFIED: (c) — PLAN-level design decision, no ADR, with the promotion tripwire
above armed.** (Cray, 2026-07-22, session 165, typed AskUserQuestion.) Consequence
for the critical path: **Step 2 does not wait for an ADR** — Steps 1–7 are
executable end to end once Step 0 lands. The tripwire is binding on the build: if
the ontology stage is found to need LLM-emitted *structure* beyond the fixed
6-object / 7-link_type grammar, or any unratified vocabulary landing without a
human confirm, the build STOPS and this ruling is re-opened as (a).

### SD-2 — v1 breadth: which of the three worked shapes?

**Question:** create-a-vertical (PLAN-0086) vs add-a-calm-path (PLAN-0089) vs
add-a-scheduled-variant (PLAN-0090).
**Recommendation: create only.** Reasoning: (1) the evidence asymmetry is total —
the seam ledger and question log exist *only* for create; the extend runs produced
timing numbers but no seam spec; (2) the golden oracle exists only for create —
PLAN-0086 SD-1(a) committed the fleet vertical expressly as this PLAN's diff target
(`0086:186-188`); (3) the wedge motion itself is create-shaped (ADR-0032 D1:
pre-build a guessed governed hero in the partner's shape); (4) Rule-of-Three
discipline (ADR-006 D4): create is N=1 *with a spec*; the extend shapes are N=2
*without one* — scaffolding them now would be abstraction ahead of evidence.
Alternatives: all-three (rejected: triples surface on the thinnest evidence);
create+scheduled (rejected: the scheduled seam's hard part — `Schedule`
governance pins — was measured but never ledgered). What makes this Cray's call:
it is a bet on where the next pilot conversation actually lands.

**RATIFIED: create only.** (Cray, 2026-07-22, session 165, typed AskUserQuestion.)
The calm-path (PLAN-0089) and scheduled (PLAN-0090) shapes stay Out of Scope for
v1; adding either requires a fresh seam spec first, not just effort.

### SD-3 — The intake form's shape and re-ask discipline

**Question:** the ledger's own closing finding is that "the tool's hard part is the
**intake form**, not the emission", and the question log is the only empirical data
about it.
**Recommendation: a typed required-slot checklist operated as an interview loop,
with guess-prefill only where guessing is licensed.** Concretely, three slot
classes with different disciplines:

1. **Schema-bearing authority/numeric slots** (the DOA ladder, waiver cap,
   rule-gate threshold + vendor count, requester role/SoD): **ask, never guess,
   never fabricate** (row 6; row 11). Asked in the customer's shape — Q1's finding:
   the ladder is **one open question**, not three ("ต้อมเคาะเองได้ถึงกี่บาท…" got the
   whole ladder in one sentence).
2. **Non-schema-bearing accountability slots** (Q2's waiver ratifier + window):
   ask; if unanswered, **do not block** — route to the README's "stated but NOT
   enforced" register (row 14) *and* keep the sub-slot on the open queue.
3. **Demo-design slots** (synthetic values inside customer-stated ranges, enum
   glosses, prose): **guess-prefill, marked** — `# GUESS — รอแก้` per value, exactly
   ADR-0032 D1's "guess — correct me" discipline.

**Re-ask discipline (the Q2 finding, made mechanical):** every question is a typed
bundle of sub-slots; an answer fills only the sub-slots it actually covers;
unfilled sub-slots stay **individually** open and re-surface on the next pass. One
number is never accepted as a full answer. The LLM's role in intake is bounded to
narrative pre-fill *proposals* (gap detection and the checklist are deterministic;
candidate enum values are proposals the operator confirms) — testable behind
recorded fixtures. Alternatives: a fixed questionnaire (rejected: Q1 shows
customer-shaped open questions outperform form fields); a fully LLM-driven
interview (rejected: un-testable offline, and the checklist — the part that failed
in the manual run — is exactly the part that must be deterministic). What makes
this Cray's call: the intake form *is* the customer-facing motion; its feel in a
real conversation is founder judgment, not derivable from four data points.

**RATIFIED: the typed required-slot checklist operated as an interview loop**, with
the three slot classes and the sub-slot re-ask discipline exactly as specified
above. (Cray, 2026-07-22, session 165, typed AskUserQuestion.) This ruling *is*
Step 1's design: the checklist and gap detection are deterministic, the LLM's
intake role is bounded to narrative pre-fill *proposals*, and one number is never
accepted as a full answer.

### SD-4 — Counted prose

**Question:** three comments along the tool's write path carry hard-coded counts;
one was stale before PLAN-0086's run even started (ledger row 9).
**Recommendation: stop writing counts into comments; where a count is load-bearing,
it must be an executable assertion.** The repo's own pattern already embodies this —
`assert total == 13` (`test_procedures_endpoint.py:151`) is a count that cannot go
silently stale; the module docstring's per-vertical tally (`:5-9`) is one that
already has. *(Line-attribution corrected session 166 — `was an error`, right
conclusion pinned to the wrong line: the stale token is "fleet_maintenance ships
**two**" at `:8`, not "six" at `:5`, which is correct. See AC-10.)* Scope discipline: this PLAN converts/removes only the three counts in
files the wire-writer touches (+ the `main.py` docstring count, row 7) — not a
repo-wide sweep. Alternative — the tool owns counted prose (rejected): it
perpetuates a drift surface with a 100% observed staleness-per-run rate, and prose
rewriting is the highest-fragility generation class the tool could take on for the
lowest value. What makes this Cray's call: it is a repo-wide authoring convention
(the same class as the Tier-0 "N=1-comment drift" lesson), not a local
implementation choice.

**RATIFIED: stop writing counts into comments; a load-bearing count must be an
executable assertion.** (Cray, 2026-07-22, session 165, typed AskUserQuestion.) The
scope discipline above holds — this PLAN converts or removes only the three counts
in files the wire-writer touches, plus the `main.py` docstring count (row 7). No
repo-wide sweep.

### SD-5 — Where does the AT-2 template live? (**RATIFIED (a)** — surfaced + adjudicated session 166)

**Why this is surfaced late.** Step 4's design note (below) promised the scaffolder
would instantiate the AT-2 template **directly**, "rather than growing the S1 classify
surface", with "the API pipeline's abstain guard … as-is". **A session-166 grounding
pass refuted that promise against code** — it is not achievable by care, it is
structurally false if the template is registered in the shared `REGISTRY`:

- **The classify catalog IS `REGISTRY`.** `generator/pipeline.py:225` —
  `catalog = [(t.archetype_id, t.title, t.description) for t in REGISTRY.values()]`.
  Registering an AT-2 template puts it in the prompt catalog on the very next
  API classify call.
- **The label route accepts whatever is in `REGISTRY`.** `pipeline.py:253` abstains
  only when `classification.archetype_id … not in REGISTRY`; `:258` then instantiates
  `REGISTRY[classification.archetype_id]`. Once AT-2 is a member, an "AT-2" label is
  a *hit*, not an abstain.
- **The abstain guard is a second layer that does NOT guarantee the old behaviour.**
  `_archetype_disagreement` (`pipeline.py:188-202`) rejects an AT-2 gate only when the
  model actually *emits* one in `step_gates` (`:190`); the function's own contract
  (`:186-187`) states an "empty/extra step list is not itself a disagreement". A
  narrative labelled AT-2 with no per-step gates therefore passes through.

**Options.**
- **(a) A separate scaffolder-owned registry / catalog** — the AT-2 template is
  constructed and instantiated by `services/engine/scaffolder/`, never inserted into
  `archetypes.template.REGISTRY`. The API classify path is byte-unchanged; ADR-0024 D7's
  "AT-2 routes to hand-author (the abstain path, D5)" stays literally true.
- **(b) Register centrally, filter at the catalog seam** — AT-2 joins `REGISTRY`, and
  `pipeline.py:225` (plus the `:253` membership test) grows an explicit
  classify-eligibility filter. Shared artifact, one shipped code path modified.
- **(c) Register centrally, accept AT-2 into the classify surface** — the API path may
  classify to AT-2. **This contradicts ADR-0024 D7/D5 as shipped and almost certainly
  needs an ADR**, which would reverse SD-1's "no ADR gates this PLAN".

**Recommendation: (a).** It is the only option that keeps SD-1 = (c) intact (no ADR),
touches zero shipped classify code, and matches the PLAN's own stated intent — the
scaffolder instantiates a template it *owns*, operator-confirmed, which trivially
satisfies ADR-0024 D5's human-confirmed-match requirement. (b) is defensible but edits a
shipped LLM route for a tool that never needed it; (c) is the largest surface change and
the only one that re-opens Step 0. **Cray's call because it decides whether the AT-2
shape becomes a shared engine asset or stays tool-local** — an asset question, not an
implementation detail. **Tripwire (binding either way):** if the build finds the
scaffolder cannot produce a valid AT-2 spine without central registration, STOP and
re-open this SD rather than registering centrally by default.

**RATIFIED: (a) — a separate scaffolder-owned registry. The AT-2 template is
constructed and instantiated by `services/engine/scaffolder/` and is NEVER inserted
into `services.engine.procedures.archetypes.template.REGISTRY`.** (Cray, 2026-07-23,
session 166, typed.) Binding consequences for the build:

1. **`REGISTRY` is not touched.** `pipeline.py:225`'s classify catalog, the `:253`
   membership test, and the `:258` instantiation therefore see exactly the AT-1 family
   they see today — the API classify path is **byte-unchanged**, and ADR-0024 D7's
   "AT-2 routes to hand-author (the abstain path, D5)" stays literally true on that
   surface.
2. **SD-1 = (c) stands undisturbed — no ADR gates this PLAN.** (a) was chosen partly
   because it is the only option that does not re-open Step 0.
3. **`test_archetype_templates.py:37` (`set(REGISTRY) == set(AT1_FAMILY)`) never
   fires**, and its family-invariant framing (`:11`, `template.py:255-257`) stays
   accurate. **Do not edit that test.** If a diff to it appears necessary, that is the
   tripwire below firing — stop, do not "fix" the assertion.
4. **The tripwire above stays ARMED.** If the build finds the scaffolder cannot produce
   a valid AT-2 spine without central registration, **STOP and re-open this SD** —
   registering centrally by default is forbidden, and doing so via (c) would also
   re-open SD-1's no-ADR ruling.
5. **Step 4 is unblocked** and no longer waits on anything.

**Deliberately left as build-time detail (not decided here):** whether the scaffolder's
AT-2 template is a module-level constant, a builder function, or a small tool-local
registry dict is an implementation choice for Step 4 — (a) constrains only that it must
not enter the shared `REGISTRY`. The `ArchetypeTemplate` **type** is reused as-is
(`template.py:108-146`: `archetype_id` / `title` / `description` / `base` / `slots` /
`terminal_slot`, `extra="forbid"`); (a) is about registration, not about forking the
artifact.

## Steps

### Step 0 — Cray adjudicates SD-1…SD-4 — ✅ **DONE (2026-07-22, session 165)**

Record the four rulings in this PLAN (edit under its Draft status). No build
before Step 0 lands; SD-1's ruling gates whether Step 2 needs an ADR first
(CLAUDE.md §8: ADR merged before related implementation).

**Outcome — all four ratified as-recommended** (Cray, typed AskUserQuestion):
**SD-1 = (c)** PLAN-level, no ADR, promotion tripwire armed · **SD-2 = create
only** · **SD-3 = typed required-slot checklist as an interview loop** ·
**SD-4 = stop counted prose; load-bearing counts become executable assertions.**
Each ruling is recorded inline at its own SD above. **Consequence: no ADR blocks
this PLAN — Steps 1–7 are executable end to end, deterministic-offline.**

**Session 166 — one further decision was surfaced and closed the same day.** SD-5 (the
AT-2 template's *placement*) was a decision the s165 adjudication never saw, because the
promise it would have tested — Step 4's "the abstain guard stays as-is" — was not
verified against `pipeline.py` until session 166. **Cray ratified SD-5 = (a)
(2026-07-23, typed):** the template is scaffolder-owned and never enters the shared
`REGISTRY`. **The "no ADR" consequence therefore stands unchanged** — (a) was chosen
partly because it is the only option that does not re-open Step 0. **All of Steps 1–7
are now executable end to end; nothing in this PLAN awaits a decision.**

**Sequencing note (session 165 claim, CORRECTED by a session-166 grounding pass).**
The s165 Explore fan-out asserted a **hard** ordering constraint: "**Step 1 has a
forward dependency on Step 4**" because its checklist is "(AT-2 obligations ×
ontology judgment slots × fixture value slots)" and no AT-2 `ArchetypeTemplate`
exists (`REGISTRY` at `archetypes/template.py:254` is `(AT1, AT1B, AT3)`). **A
session-166 fan-out refuted the strong form against code** — classify `was an
error` (an over-strong inference, not a code change since s165):

- The AT-2 obligation set is derivable **without any template**:
  `derive_governance_todo` (`services/engine/procedures/draft.py:293-322`) computes
  the owed governance from `(gate_kind, kind)` alone — it never reads `REGISTRY`.
  The AT-2 leaf value slots are enumerable straight from the typed governance models
  (`spec.py` `DoaLadder`/`DoaTier`/`EmergencyWaiverPolicy`/`ScoredRule`/
  `ComplianceGate`/`SeverityLadder`).
- The row-11 spine **sequence** is already on disk in the golden donor
  (`verticals/fleet_maintenance/procedures.yaml:117-282`:
  intake→judge→reshape→rule_gate→approve→fulfill).

**What survives is only the weak form:** a step/gate *sequence* must be fixed before
per-step obligations are enumerated — and that sequence is **readable off the donor**,
so Step 1 is **not blocked** on Step 4. The order **4-shape → 1 → 2 → 3 → 4-emit →
5 → 6 → 7** is a **convenience, not a constraint**; co-designing the AT-2 template
shape alongside Step 1 remains sensible but is not forced. (See also SD-5 below —
the *real* Step-4 hazard is the `REGISTRY` classify-coupling, not an ordering one.)

### Step 1 — Intake engine (`services/engine/scaffolder/intake.py`)

The typed `IntakeRecord` (operator-input-only value slots), the deterministic
required-slot checklist derived from (AT-2 obligations × ontology judgment slots ×
fixture value slots), the question queue with sub-slot decomposition + re-ask
discipline (SD-3), guess-marking, and the "stated but NOT enforced" register feed.
Committed fixtures: the fleet-shaped narrative (AC-2) and the fleet golden intake
record (AC-7). Oracle: AC-1, AC-2.

### Step 2 — Ontology emitter + the invoked floor

Skeleton from the 6-object grammar + 7 link_types; the three judgment slots +
mined enums filled only from confirmed intake; then invoke `vero-lite validate` +
`generate` into the scratch tree and require EXIT 0. (~~If SD-1 = (a)/(b), this step
waits for that ADR.~~ — **resolved: SD-1 = (c), no ADR; this step does not wait.**)
Oracle: AC-3.

**Session-166 build note (friction, not a blocker): "into the scratch tree" costs a
chdir.** `vero-lite validate` / `generate` resolve their paths **CWD-relative** with no
root override — `cli.py:25-30` hardcodes `f"verticals/{vertical}/ontology/…"` and
`Path(f"verticals/{vertical}/generated")`. Invoking the floor against a scratch tree
therefore requires staging + `os.chdir`, exactly the shipped pattern in
`tests/services/engine/test_cli_e2e.py:26-41` (`staged_repo`, chdir in a
try/finally). Reuse that pattern rather than adding a `--root` flag to the shipped
commands — ADR-0015 D2 keeps `validate`/`generate` as they are.

### Step 3 — Package emitter

Rows 1/3/4/5 + the `synthetic.py` skeleton with traceable-or-marked values and
latest-per-asset ordering + the README with the gap register. Oracle: AC-4.

### Step 4 — The AT-2 template + spine emitter

Add one `ArchetypeTemplate` for the row-11 spine, reusing the D4
signature-agreement machinery. ✅ **UNBLOCKED — SD-5 ratified (a): the template is
owned by `services/engine/scaffolder/` and NEVER enters the shared `REGISTRY`.**
The original design note here promised the API pipeline's abstain guard
(`pipeline.py:82,190`) would stay as-is because the scaffolder instantiates the AT-2
template **directly, operator-confirmed**, "rather than growing the S1 classify
surface". A session-166 grounding pass found that promise is structurally false **if
the template is registered centrally** (`pipeline.py:225` builds the classify catalog
from `REGISTRY.values()`; `:253/:258` route by label through the same dict) — **(a)
resolves it by construction:** nothing enters `REGISTRY`, so the classify path is
byte-unchanged and the promise holds as written. The intent — operator-confirmed
direct instantiation satisfying ADR-0024 D5, classify untouched — is preserved
exactly. Growing classify to AT-2 stays deliberately deferred until the API path
wants it. **The SD-5 tripwire is ARMED:** if a valid AT-2 spine turns out to be
impossible without central registration, STOP and re-open SD-5.

**Second finding (session 166) — one unbudgeted RED test this PLAN never named.**
`tests/services/engine/procedures/test_archetype_templates.py:37` asserts
`set(REGISTRY) == set(AT1_FAMILY)` with `AT1_FAMILY = ["AT-1", "AT-1b", "AT-3"]`
(`:31`) — it would go **RED the moment an AT-2 template is registered centrally**,
along with the family-invariant framing in its module docstring (`:11`, "NO AT-2-only
kind") and `template.py:255-257` ("the AT-1 family only (D7)"). **Under the ratified
SD-5 (a) this test never fires** — nothing enters `REGISTRY`, and its framing stays
accurate. **Treat any need to edit it as the SD-5 tripwire firing, not as a test to
update.** (Had (b)/(c) been chosen it would have had to be re-argued, and the AT-2
template would have needed its own agreement test, since
`test_archetype_agreement_signature` (`:81-93`) encodes "no AT-2-only kind" as the
*family* invariant — a cost that helped decide (a).) Related pre-existing drift to fix
or note while here:
`test_archetype_templates.py:32` `AT2_ONLY_KINDS` omits `GateKind.SEVERITY_TIER`,
which both `pipeline.py:82-84` and `draft.py:283-285` include.

The
emitter injects intake values into H-class fields, stubs the unanswered, declares
`compliance_criteria` per PLAN-0087, and runs `prose_lint` pre-emit. Oracle: AC-5.

### Step 5 — Wire-writer

The four wire points (both registrar maps with the lazy-import convention;
`PROCEDURE_ARCHETYPES` classified from gate content; census `_EXPECTED` + total),
plus the SD-4 disposition of the counted comments. Oracle: AC-6, AC-10.

### Step 6 — Governance-ceiling detector

Extract the census fingerprint helpers (`_at2_gate_kinds`, `_content_enum_surface`,
`test_at2_signature_retrigger.py:219-257`) into an engine module consumed by both
the census test and the tool — **the baseline list and both assertions stay in the
test, byte-identical**; this refactor may not weaken the tripwire (the test's
set-equality against `_BASELINE_SIGNATURES` must still fire on a genuine 5th
signature — R2 verifies the assertion is untouched). The tool predicts the would-be
signature, and on baseline extension STOPS pre-wire-write with the comparison
table. Oracle: AC-8.

**Session-166 grounding — the tripwire citations are `confirmed — prior intact`**
(re-checked against a pass/fail read fixed before the run; a passed check is not a
defect): all four cited ranges are byte-exact on disk — helpers `:219-227` /
`:230-257`, `_BASELINE_SIGNATURES` `:167-205`, the set-equality `:307-319`, the
obligation-owned guard `:322-342` — and **exactly one** assertion (`:315`) goes RED on
a genuine 5th signature, which is what this Step asserts. Two build hazards the Step
did not name:

1. **Do not inherit the CWD-relative scan.** `_distinct_at2_signatures`
   (`test_at2_signature_retrigger.py:269`) globs `Path("verticals").glob(…)` relative
   to the CWD. The tool predicts the signature of a spine it is about to write into a
   **scratch tree**, so the extracted helper must take an explicit root — extracting
   the glob as-is would silently fingerprint the repo instead of the scratch tree and
   make AC-8 vacuous.
2. **Four in-file call sites move with the helpers** (`:275`, `:290`, `:300` indirect,
   `:400`, `:403-405`) — the extraction is not a two-line move, and R2 must confirm
   each call site still resolves to the same values.

### Step 7 — Golden end-to-end + gate

The fleet regeneration diff-oracle (AC-7), the non-capability asserts (AC-9), full
offline gate (`mypy services/` + full `tests/`, per the CI-scope rule), closeout
evidence. Then — separately, Cray-gated, evidence-not-gate — at most one live smoke
(§ Verification).

## Verification

- **The offline oracle is the gate** (CLAUDE.md §8). AC-1…AC-10 run with MS-S1
  unreachable; LLM stages are exercised via recorded fixtures (the PLAN-0040 D12
  pattern, already proven for this pipeline).
- **What one live run would catch that fixtures cannot** (named per the
  fixture-masking hazard): whether the real `gpt-oss:20b` (a) proposes action-type
  / enum candidates that collide with the grammar's reserved names or drift from
  the closed vocabularies the fixtures encode, (b) handles a **Thai-language**
  narrative's numerals and role nouns as well as the fixture assumes (the real
  customer answers are Thai — Q1–Q4), and (c) abstains where the fixture says it
  abstains. One live smoke, explicit Cray go before it, result recorded as
  evidence in the closeout — never as an AC.
- **The tool's own success claim is falsifiable by construction:** AC-7 is a diff
  against a committed, hand-built donor the tool's spec was measured on. If the
  regenerated fleet does not structurally match the real one, the tool is wrong —
  not the oracle.

## Closeout — session 167, 2026-07-23 (recorded 8/10 ACs; actually 7/10 — see the s168 closeout below)

> **Superseded, kept intact.** This section is the s167 record as written; the s168
> closeout at the end completes it and corrects the count. It is not edited away,
> because the reasoning that produced a partial close is the thing worth keeping.

**Built and merged as seven PRs**, each gate-green and SHA-verified against the
head it ran on: #873 Step 1 (intake engine + `vero-lite scaffold`) · #874 Step 2
(ontology emitter + the invoked floor) · #875 Step 3 (package emitter) · #876
Step 4 (the AT-2 spine) · #877 Step 5 (wire-writer) · #878 Step 6 (ceiling
detector) · #879 Step 7 (golden diff-oracle). `main` = `f28c8e3`.

**Verification of record.** Full suite on the merge commit `f28c8e3`:
**3083 passed / 7 skipped** — the session began at 2994, and every step's delta
matched its new-test count exactly (+16 / +12 / +14 / +12 / +14 / +8 / +13).
`ruff check .` and `mypy --strict services/` (106 files) clean at CI scope.
**MS-S1 was never contacted in any step** — the tool has no code path that could
(AC-9, asserted structurally).

**SD-5's tripwire never fired.** `AT2_SPINE` is scaffolder-owned and absent from
the shared `REGISTRY`; `test_archetype_templates.py` is untouched and its
`set(REGISTRY) == set(AT1_FAMILY)` assertion is green. The Step-6 extraction
moved the fingerprint FUNCTION only — `_BASELINE_SIGNATURES` and both census
assertions stayed byte-identical, and all four in-file call sites were preserved
by importing the helpers back under their original private names.

### Why this was NOT archived at s167 — and what changed

AC-7 and AC-10 were **partial**. Archiving a PLAN with two unmet ACs would record a
completion that did not happen — the exact failure the tool's own no-fabrication
scanner exists to prevent, applied to governance rather than to demo numbers. The
remainders were small and named; whether they were built, re-scoped, or dropped was
Cray's call, not a bookkeeping step.

**Cray ruled BUILD (typed, AskUserQuestion, session 168)** — including AC-7(a), on the
operator-typed route rather than narrative mining. See the s168 closeout below.

## Closeout — session 168, 2026-07-23 (10/10 ACs met; ARCHIVED)

Four PRs, all merged; `main` = `c2b92c5`; full suite **3109 passed / 7 skipped** re-run on
the merge commit (CI is PR-only, so the merge commit is never otherwise tested), `ruff` +
`mypy --strict services/` (106 files) clean.

| PR | What |
|----|------|
| [#883](https://github.com/CrayJThiemsert/vero-lite/pull/883) | AC-7(b)+(c) — the emitted package made loadable — and AC-7(a) via operator-typed domain columns. Also makes AC-4 true. |
| [#884](https://github.com/CrayJThiemsert/vero-lite/pull/884) | The `vero-lite scaffold` command wired to the emitters (see Deviation 3). |
| [#885](https://github.com/CrayJThiemsert/vero-lite/pull/885) | AC-10 — the collection-count shape, plus the reported-not-rewritten residue. |
| [#886](https://github.com/CrayJThiemsert/vero-lite/pull/886) | Not this PLAN: settles PLAN-0092's parked SD-D, found while re-reading the closeout. |

**The arithmetic held across all six of the session's PRs.** 3083 → 3109, and the
per-PR deltas (+0 docs, +1, +18, +2, +3, +2) summed to the merge-commit total exactly —
predicted before the run and matched after it. A mismatch anywhere would have meant a
silently dropped or duplicated test.

**Non-vacuity was probed, never assumed — six times**, each restoring from `/tmp` and
verifying `cmp -s` byte-identical (never `git checkout`, which wipes the edit under test
and produces a false pass). The two that mattered most reproduced defects that had
actually shipped: restoring the two-argument `register_adapter` call reddened both new
guards with `TypeError: too many positional arguments`, and disabling the collection
substitution reddened all three new AC-10 assertions.

**MS-S1 was never contacted.** Every AC remains offline-verifiable.

**What the s167 count got wrong, recorded rather than quietly fixed:** "8/10" was really
**7/10** — AC-4 was ticked while its own text required a `procedures_factory.py` that did
not exist. See the AC-4 closeout correction above (`was an error`, not `superseded`).

### Deviations, recorded not absorbed

1. **A FOURTH ontology judgment slot** — `ontology.site_noun` (the PLAN names
   three). The grammar's Site object is not mechanically derivable: the donor
   names it `Depot`, and AC-7 asserts the object SET matches, so a generic `Site`
   would fail the diff-oracle by construction. Same KIND of judgment as the Asset
   noun; asked rather than guessed. Shipped in #874, flagged in its PR body.
2. **`AT2_ONLY_KINDS` drift noted, not fixed** —
   `test_archetype_templates.py:32` omits `GateKind.SEVERITY_TIER`, which
   `pipeline.py:82-84` and `draft.py:283-285` include. The PLAN said "fix or
   note"; noting, because that file is the one the SD-5 tripwire guards and
   editing it alongside the AT-2 work would muddy the signal the tripwire exists
   to send. Belongs in its own small PR. **CLOSED s168 (#882)** — fixed in its own
   PR as prescribed, with an anti-drift tripwire pinning the local copy to
   `pipeline._AT2_ONLY_KINDS`. Deliberately NOT pinned to `draft._AT2_GATE_KINDS`:
   that is a *distinct* concept the design says so in its own docstring, and PLAN-0074
   grew the two under separate ACs. The SD-5-guarded assertion is byte-unchanged.
3. **The `vero-lite scaffold` COMMAND was never wired to the emitters** (found and
   closed s168, #884). Steps 2–4 shipped in #874–#876, but `cli.py` still exited `3`
   with *"Emission is not wired yet (PLAN-0091 Steps 2-4)"* and wrote nothing — the
   emitters existed only as a **library**. Found by running the shipped command, not
   by reading it: the queue rendered and `ls verticals/` showed no new directory.

   **Why every oracle stayed green through a whole PLAN.** The golden e2e calls
   `emit_ontology` / `write_package` / `emit_procedures` / `write_wires` **directly**,
   and AC-1 only claims `--help` + `--plan-only`. No test pinned the exit-3 behaviour
   either way, so nothing objected in either direction. This is the sharpest lesson of
   the build and it generalises past this PLAN: **a test suite addressed at the library
   cannot see that the entry point is dead.** The AC set was satisfiable without the
   tool being usable.

   Wiring it also closed a latent guard bypass that becomes live the moment emission
   works: the overwrite guard checked `verticals/<argument>` while every emitter writes
   to `verticals/<record.namespace>`, so an `--intake` file naming a different namespace
   would route the write **past the guard** onto whatever the file named — potentially a
   shipped vertical. The two must now match or the command refuses.

   Verified by running it and then importing what it produced: registrar binds
   (`LiveFleetSyntheticAdapter`), the factory module exists, `fetch_objects('Truck')`
   returns rows keyed with `plate` and **without** `name`, `health_check` → ok.

### Findings the build produced (each caught by running the thing, not reading it)

- **The trace-kind guard fired on the emitter's governance dicts** (`doa_tier`,
  `rule_gate`). Its docstring says such a collision "forces a conscious call.
  That is intended." The call: these are governance-content discriminators, not
  trace kinds, so the content is now built through the TYPED models — which also
  closed a latent bug, since `DoaLadder` REQUIRES an `emergency_waiver` and the
  raw-dict path would have emitted a ladder without one that fails at load.
- **The pre-emit prose lint was initially too broad** — it used the generator's
  `prose_lint` and refused language the shipped donor itself uses. The loader's
  own AT-2 check uses the SCOPED `governance_prose_lint`; the emitter now matches.
- **The first emission did not load** — `run_by` named an agent no `agents` block
  declared. Caught by the round-trip test invoking the real `load_procedures`.
- **A CI-only test failure** — an AC-1 assertion read Typer's rich-rendered
  `--help` text, which wraps differently per terminal. Replaced with an assertion
  over the registered Click parameters, which no renderer can wrap.
