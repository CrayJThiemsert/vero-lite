# STATUS.md rotation archive — 2026 H1 (recent window, base file)

> **Period covered:** 2026-07-17 (session-142) → onward (the RECENT window)
> **Sibling chain (letters ascend with time; the base file holds the RECENT window):** [`2026-h1b-status.md`](2026-h1b-status.md) (2026-05-10 → 2026-06-09) → [`2026-h1c-status.md`](2026-h1c-status.md) → [`2026-h1d-status.md`](2026-h1d-status.md) → [`2026-h1e-status.md`](2026-h1e-status.md) → [`2026-h1f-status.md`](2026-h1f-status.md) → [`2026-h1-status.md`](2026-h1-status.md) (base, newest — rotations append HERE). The separate `2026-h1-current-focus.md` (sessions ≤46, ratified as-is) is a Current-Focus-only artifact predating this chain.


Rotated out of `docs/STATUS.md` per the **STATUS.md Rotation Policy**
(`docs/runbooks/memory-architecture.md`, Lesson #23). Tier-3: **grep + windowed reads
only, never a whole-file Read.**

**Split lineage.** At session 80 the combined `2026-h1-status.md` first crossed R4's
~192 KB bar and was split into a recent-window file and its `-b` sibling. The recent
window then grew back to **592,577 B — 3.01x the split trigger and 2.26x the 256 KB
cap** — because R4 had no mechanism: its responsibility-matrix guard column read `—`
where R1 and R7 read `fail`. Session 144 added that mechanism
(`tools/check_archive_size.py`, #789) and this file is one of the four it forced.
**No content lost:** every section is preserved verbatim and exactly once across the
chain, verified by exact list equality at split time, not by a byte-sum estimate.

**Structural note (honest).** R4 describes an archive as TWO sections — rotated
Current Focus blocks and rotated Recent Decisions rows, *newest at top*. That is not
the shape on disk: the file drifted into **one section per reconcile, appended at the
bottom** (27 of them by session 144), and the old preamble's own "Period covered" had
gone stale years of sessions ago. This split preserves the drifted shape rather than
silently rewriting history to match the spec — reconciling R4's text with the real
convention is separate work, deliberately not done here.

## Rotated this reconcile (session-163, 2026-07-22 — the s162 fleet AT-3 calm-path reconcile PLUS the R2 pointer-rule trim of Recent Decisions + Active TODOs)

Two passes in one PR: the reconcile rotated the usual window (one RD row, two rotation notes) and retired one Active TODO as discharged; the trim then compressed the surviving RD rows and the over-length Active TODOs to the R2 ~600-char pointer form. Every pre-trim original is preserved below verbatim — the trim is a compression in STATUS, never a deletion from the repository.

### Recent-Decisions row rotated out of the 10-row window — s151 / PLAN-0081 (#814) [rotated 2026-07-22, session-163 reconcile]

| 2026-07-19 | **s151 — PLAN-0081 BUILT end to end (#814, `feat(building_materials)`): the `building_materials` governed-credit HERO — the 3rd AT-2 signature (`building_materials.governed_credit_release`), Cray-commissioned this session. An exposure breach above the account's own `credit_limit_thb` routes the full governed AT-2 spine (per-entity band → `rule_gate` KYC/overdue-AR/blacklist → `doa_tier` approval + SoD); the ฿550,000 breach routes mid-ladder.** The 3rd signature REUSES the money `doa_tier` ladder UNCHANGED (no new gate kind / authority quantity) — only `ComplianceCriterion += {kyc, overdue_ar, blacklist}` grows; engine diff bounded to that additive `spec.py` block (the `Person` promotion was PLAN-0082's, already on main). **ADR-0025 D7 re-eval PERFORMED at N=3** (Cray-ratified: generator stays deferred, marker re-arms N=4). Closeout: PLAN-0079 tracking stub RETIRED (Step T3) + guard test DELETED; PLAN-0076 T1 gate-seam trigger recorded MET (seam PLAN un-opened); PLAN-0081 archived at 15/15 ACs. Suite **2896/7** re-run on the merge commit `9422c40`; mypy strict + ruff clean.

### Active TODO RETIRED AS DISCHARGED — "AT-2 stale N=2 / N=3 signature counts" [retired 2026-07-22, session-163 reconcile]

**Retirement basis — the item was FALSE, not merely stale.** Session 160 (#845 / #846) had already corrected all three artifacts it names, verified on disk this session: `services/engine/procedures/spec.py` states N=4 (its surviving N=2/N=3 tokens are correctly-framed historical narrative of the firing arc); `docs/adr/0025-at2-managerial-layer.md` carries a dated 2026-07-22 OUTCOME amendment whose "N >= 2" decision text is deliberately preserved rather than rewritten (the G1-safe pattern); `docs/adr/0032-strategic-frame-demo-to-pilot-wedge-and-3-shape-roadmap.md` is re-grounded to N=4. This is a retirement, not a trim.

- [ ] **AT-2 stale `N=2` / `N=3` signature counts — doc drift across three artifacts (surfaced s155).** _[s157 UPDATE: the deferral is now **CANCELLED**, so the drift is doubly stale — fold the corrections into the G1-gated edits the extraction PLAN will carry rather than fixing them piecemeal.]_ _[s158 UPDATE — **STILL OPEN, and the fold-in did NOT happen**: PLAN-0087's only Accepted-ADR edit was the ADR-0031 **D3 row-3** update its own AC-7 obligated (D4.4), scoped to a single table row. **ADR-0025 D7 and ADR-0032 still carry the stale counts**, and `spec.py`'s comments moved but were not audited for N-counts. So this item is unchanged in substance: it now needs its own small `plan-drafter` dispatch rather than a ride-along. Same reasoning as before — nothing turns RED on it, but every stale count is a wrong premise for the next AT-2 scoping call.]_ _[s159 CONFIRMED: PLAN-0087 **closed out + archived at 8/8 without carrying the fold-in**, so the ride-along option is now GONE — the item is confirmed to need its own small `plan-drafter` dispatch.]_ The pre-s157 live value was **`N=3`, with the ADR-0025 D7 generator marker RE-ARMING at `N=4`** (Cray-ratified at the s151 PLAN-0081 re-eval). Stale counts survive in: **(1)** `services/engine/procedures/spec.py` comments — **ungated, fix freely**; **(2) ADR-0025 D7** and **(3) ADR-0032** — both **G1-gated Accepted-body edits**, so they route via `plan-drafter`, never a direct Code write. Only `tests/services/engine/procedures/test_at2_signature_retrigger.py` carries the correct `_RETRIGGER_N = 4`, so the *test* is the source of truth and nothing turns RED on the prose drift. _[Irony worth preserving: **ADR-0032's own Positive-consequences section claims it makes exactly this stale-N-count error class harder to reintroduce** — and it now carries that very drift.]_ *(s155; blocks nothing, but every stale count is a wrong premise for the next AT-2 scoping call.)*

### Pre-trim originals — the 9 Recent-Decisions rows compressed to the R2 pointer rule [trimmed 2026-07-22, session-163]

Trim basis: the Decision cell only; the Date column and the entire Reference column survive byte-untouched in STATUS, because R2's own wording ("full detail lives in the referenced ADR/PLAN/PR, which every row already links") makes the link the thing the rule preserves. One carve-out HIT was retained verbatim in STATUS and NOT compressed: the s156 model-economy ratification, whose only home is a private Tier-0 auto-memory.

| 2026-07-22 | **s161 — PLAN-0088 filed Draft (#848, `docs(plans)`): the cross-run read substrate + run-insight readers. Grounding: the repo records everything PER-RUN but aggregates NOTHING across runs (the only SQL aggregate in `services/` is the audit-chain count; `GET /runs` materializes every run in Python). Two Cray-ratified TYPED forks are the PLAN's LOCKED constraints — L1: "Group A" (NL-over-runs, ฿ ROI, bottleneck/cycle-time, audit-readiness) is NOT Shape 2 and does NOT trip the ADR-0032 D2 pilot gate, and the separation is proven by a STATIC guard (AC-11), not prose; L2: build Group A + PROVE the substrate expresses Group B (4 executable query-shape tests, AC-10) but do NOT build Group B — it stays pilot-gated.** Wall-clock ordering hazard PINNED not inherited (order-insensitive aggregates, coarse buckets, an AC-3 AST tripwire) — the sequence-column PLAN stays UNOPENED; cross-currency sums made UNREPRESENTABLE (group key includes `currency`, no total field).

### Pre-trim originals — the 6 Active TODO items compressed to the R2 pointer rule [trimmed 2026-07-22, session-163]

Each was trimmed only after its tracked home was verified on disk (the R2 carve-out): PLAN-0087 + PLAN-0076 §A, PLAN-0076, PLAN-0062/0077/0078, the `tests/services/db/test_load_run_ordering_guard.py` module docstring, PLAN-0063 + the `services/api/routers/audit.py` SD-4 docstring, and the PLAN-0035 §SD-3 post-archival amendment.

- [ ] **The AT-2 extraction — PLAN-0087 is COMPLETE, 8/8 ACs, and ARCHIVED to `docs/plans/done/` (s159, #841); the CRITERION-VOCABULARY half SHIPPED (s158, #840) and only the F-FACTORY half remains, owned by PLAN-0076 T1.** ADR-0025 D7's generator deferral was **CANCELLED at N=4** (Cray-ratified, typed, 2026-07-21) after `fleet_maintenance` became the 4th consecutive vertical to force an engine-level `ComplianceCriterion` extension. **PLAN-0087** (`docs/plans/done/0087-gate-seam-declared-criterion-vocabulary.md` — `plan-drafter`-authored, Code R2 + commits; closed out s159 with Status `Draft` → **COMPLETE** [never `Accepted` — that status G1-gates a PLAN's own closeout], all 8 ACs re-read against **fresh on-disk evidence**, plus a **Closeout** section recording the evidence read and what was deliberately left undone) discharges the vocabulary half: `ComplianceCriterion` is **retired from engine code**, each vertical **declares** its own `rule_gate` vocabulary in its `procedures.yaml` (`VerticalProcedures.compliance_criteria`, pattern-typed + membership-validated at load), and **a new AT-2 vertical ships its gate with ZERO engine diff** — proven by AC-1's proof pair (a fixture criterion existing nowhere in `services/` loads + gates, with a static guard keeping it that way), not asserted. Behaviour-preserving: **no pinned governance hash moved** (the declaration block is outside the pin surface — the `principals` precedent). Cray ratified the scope split **SD-1 = (a)** (typed, s158): **the procedure-aware `ExecutorFactory` half is NOT in PLAN-0087** and stays owned by **PLAN-0076 Step T1**, triggers armed — its evidence is an *inert* audit display-flag over-mark with zero live `step_id` collisions, versus the vocabulary half's 4-engine-edits-in-4-verticals. `test_at2_extraction_obligation_is_owned` still turns RED if PLAN-0076 is archived or loses the `N=4` record; **no guard re-homing occurred, deliberately** (re-homing is required only when PLAN-0076 archives, and T1 is only partially discharged). _[s159 closeout also left OPEN, deliberately: `scored_rule._KNOWN_CRITERIA` was NOT opened — zero extension pressure to date and its shape is `derive`-grammar-like, not vocabulary-like.]_ *(s157 #838 → s158 PR #840 → s159 closeout PR #841)*
- [ ] **PLAN-0075 follow-ons — homed by PLAN-0076 (`Status: Tracking`, filed #752, s133): T1, the ADR-0031 D3 gate-plugin seam (F-FACTORY), is now **PARTIALLY discharged** — its criterion-vocabulary half shipped as PLAN-0087 (s158, PR #840; PLAN-0087 itself COMPLETE + archived s159, #841), its procedure-aware-`ExecutorFactory` half stays OPEN and owned here — **PLAN-0076 itself stays in active `docs/plans/`, its AC-6 guard ARMED, no re-homing**; Step T2's F-PIN remainder CLOSED s143 (#784, PLAN-0078 PR-5).** _[T2 closed ≠ F-PIN closed: **F-PIN itself stays OPEN** (`docs/plans/done/0078-transform-seed-migration.md` L-4 — PLAN-0078 closed s144 COMPLETE at 12/12 and archived, but **no artifact records F-PIN closed**) — only T2's remainder fold-in closed, so **PLAN-0076 does NOT archive** and its guard stays ARMED.]_ A guardrail against the ADR-0031 OQ-4 deferral-rot precedent (s133 4-specialist panel); PLAN-0075 itself is **COMPLETE — all 13 ACs — and CLOSED → `docs/plans/done/0075-*.md`**. Full detail: `docs/plans/0076-at2-followon-tracking-gate-seam-and-derivation-pin.md` — F-FACTORY `:61-127`. **Guard:** PLAN-0076's AC-6 presence guard-test (`tests/services/engine/procedures/test_at2_followon_tracking_guard.py`) turns the build RED on a premature archive-to-`done/` or a pruned STATUS pointer ("location≠tripwire; failing tests are the real anti-rot"). *(PLAN-0075 = #749/#751 → `done/`; PLAN-0076 = #752, `Status: Tracking`; T2 closed by #784.)*
- [ ] **Rock 3 — Box-4 economics + the procedure→ontology data-binding gap (O-2) — open ONLY for the O-2 residue; every other leg is DONE + archived.** **Closed:** Q3 ontology data-binding (PLAN-0046) · the Q4 generic query executor (PLAN-0048) · the Q4 join/projection grammar (ADR-016 Q4 amendment #659 + PLAN-0061) · the per-vertical seed migration (PLAN-0062) · the per-entity `threshold_field` band arc (PLAN-0066/0067/0068/0070) · **Box-4 BUILT (PLAN-0071, AC-5 GREEN at N=4) + SURFACED IN THE HERO UI (PLAN-0073)** — all → `docs/plans/done/`. **The one OPEN residue:** procurement's `intake` is declared-expressible ✔ under shadow parity, but **production execution stays the co-existing `_SeedQuery` ✖ for derived fields** — `docs/plans/done/0062-per-vertical-seed-migration.md:348`, the SD-C co-exist decision `:54-60`, `:291-295`. **Now homed by the transform arc:** **PLAN-0077** (transform grammar, COMPLETE → `done/0077-*.md`) + **PLAN-0078** (**COMPLETE at 12/12 ACs, CLOSED s144 #786 → `done/0078-*.md`** — the Step-7 closeout swept AC-5/AC-6 and archived it; do NOT re-open) — the fold-in is named at `docs/plans/0076-*.md:170-174`, what stays seed-side at `docs/plans/done/0078-transform-seed-migration.md:150-155`. *(s84 strategy discussion; the Box-4 leg is DONE — the residue is the O-2 data-binding leg only.)*
- [ ] **Bounded/incremental chain verification (PLAN-0063 SD-4 follow-up, s118).** `GET /audit/verify` walks the WHOLE chain O(n) on demand — accepted at pilot scale, documented in the endpoint docstring (`services/api/routers/audit.py:13-16`). Future work = a checkpointed head / verify-since-anchor design; anchor storage ≈ external anchoring — **do not build without re-reading the tripwire: `docs/plans/done/0063-audit-chain-verification-surface.md:564` + `services/api/routers/audit.py:19`.** _[Corrected s141: this item used to say "ADR-011 tripwire territory" — **ADR-011 does not exist** (`docs/adr/` jumps 0010 → 0012; it is an earmark only); the tripwire text lives at the two anchors above.]_ *(s118; #688/#690)*
- [ ] **DEFERRED: a monotonic `sequence` column on `step_results` — the ROOT fix for `load_run`'s wall-clock ordering.** Needs a DB migration → its own PLAN (PLAN-0062-independent); none drafted. `ORDER BY created_at` is **unchanged by design**, so **the deferral STANDS**; both surviving orderings are **DISPLAY-ONLY**, so not urgent. Full detail — ROOT-vs-guard, why it is tolerable, the static AST guard holding the line: the module docstring of `tests/services/db/test_load_run_ordering_guard.py`, pointed to from both code sites. _[s161 UPDATE — **the deferral STANDS and this PLAN is still UNOPENED**: **PLAN-0088** (#848) is the first PLAN to read runs *in aggregate*, and it was written DELIBERATELY not to depend on either ordering — order-insensitive aggregates only, day-or-coarser buckets, no cross-row wall-clock arithmetic, plus its own AC-3 AST tripwire forbidding `ORDER BY` on raw wall-clock columns. The un-defer trigger is unchanged and now has a named watch-point: the pinned doctrine (`test_load_run_ordering_guard.py:29-49`) says *"if a correctness path ever starts depending on either ordering, the sequence-column PLAN stops being optional"* — so any Group-B / ordering-sensitive read proposed on top of the substrate re-opens this item FIRST.]_ *(rehomed s142; s117; #678/#680/#684)*
- [ ] **Demo card UX — "trust shape", NO operator confidence badge (s74 design, Cray-approved).** The operator card shows **what / grounded-why / approve gate** + a "show full reasoning trace" toggle; **no confidence badge** (`confidence_signal` is engine-internal QA, trace-only), and the **(B) first-class `verification` field is NOT needed** — SD-3 settles at (a). Full record + rationale + the reconsider-trigger: **`docs/plans/done/0035-governed-action-verify-reshape-build.md:576`** — the s142 post-archival amendment ANSWERING SD-3's Phase-2 question; `ADR-0030` cites it. *(Trigger: the next demo / UI round.)*
