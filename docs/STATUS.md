## Current Focus

> **Session 54 (current) — PLAN-0022 "tiered decision routing" landed as
> Draft (#259, head_commit `f5eba1b`, `docs(plans):`); the deferred
> tiered-handler-grading follow-up is now a committed plan.** Cowork drafted it
> (ADR-009 D1) off the session-54 Code dispatch + the design seed; Code ran the
> ADR-009 D3 receive sequence — `validate_handoff.py` **clean** on the companion
> handoff, plus an **R2 fact-pack review that re-verified Cowork's two
> load-bearing catches against HEAD**: **FP-2/SD-6** — `services/engine/procedures/`
> ships exactly one concrete `StepExecutor` (`ActionStepExecutor`); `StepKind.EVALUATE`
> exists but executors are caller-provided and **no `watch_margin` lives under
> `services/`** (benchmark-only), so a deterministic `evaluate` executor is a real
> **prerequisite** for `watch→gated` wiring; **FP-1/SD-7** — aquaculture
> `procedures.yaml` routes `verdict: watch → human_task` (a bare visual check),
> **not** silence, so the change is an *upgrade* (bare "go look" → a `gated`
> proposal). The PLAN renders Cray's two-axis reframe (threshold clear × data
> clear/ambiguous) into (1) tier the benchmark grader
> (canonical/acceptable/forbidden) and (2) wire the deterministic `watch` band →
> a `gated` human-escalation — trigger = the engine watch band, **never**
> `confidence` (ADR-010 IN-3, load-bearing AC-3). Covers all 5 dispatch areas;
> SD-1..SD-5 = the design-seed OQs, **SD-6/SD-7 newly surfaced**. **Also received**
> (gitignored research, no commit): **3 Build-Vertical narratives** (one each
> energy/supply_chain/aquaculture — each carries a clear breach + a borderline
> `watch`, so they double as PLAN-0022 routing fixtures; **S-1** = aquaculture
> uses ammonia not the benchmark's DO/aerate, Cowork recommends KEEP; **S-3** =
> a deterministic `dwell_minutes` co-gate candidate that escalates `watch`
> **without** an ADR-010 reopen), and the **gpt-oss model-selection rubric
> R1–R6** (recorded in #258). **NEXT:** Cray adjudicates PLAN-0022
> **SD-1..SD-7** → ratify Draft → Ready for execution; the **ADR-016 D3

PLAN-003 Phase 1 (ontology engine + 5 emitters), PLAN-0005 Phase 2
(OCT engine runtime layer), PLAN-0006 (LLM reasoning hook),
PLAN-0007 Phase 1 (harness autonomy layer — deterministic floor),
and **PLAN-0008 Phase 2 (harness autonomy layer — probabilistic /
classifier-mediated engine on top of Phase 1)** are all **merged and

| 2026-06-11 | **PLAN-0020 (Procedure-path tuning) COMPLETE + archived to done/ (#251–#256, `a6125c1`, session 53)** — the PLAN-0019 B-6 ring-fence follow-up. All `--dump-json`-VERIFIED on `gpt-oss:20b`/MS-S1: the Phase-1 aqua prompt nudge (PR #232, prev.

## In-Flight Discussions

- **ADR-012 guarded trial (Cowork second free-form tier):** Accepted 2026-05-22 (`7916b39`) as a guarded trial — Cowork gains Tier-1b (repo-grounded free-form / thinking-partner / informal code review) alongside Chat (repo-blind blue-sky). Regression triggers R-FF1..R-FF4 are the exit criteria; under observation across the next sessions.
- **Partner-trial-readiness gaps:** `docs/research/private/2026-05-22-partner-trial-readiness-gaps.md` — Cowork's engine→design-partner-trial gap analysis (gap groups A–E; recommended T0–T4 sequence). Informational; awaits a dedicated Cray roadmap discussion. Key fork: NL-query-first ("wow demo on synthetic") vs real-data-first ("show me MY data").
- **PLAN-002 (Database setup):** Custom Postgres image with pgvector + Apache AGE + pg_trgm. Not yet drafted. **Note:** ADR-005 was originally reserved for this decision (PLAN-001 line 9 forward-reference); ADR-005 was reused for the strategic pivot, so the Postgres-image ADR needs a fresh number (**≥ ADR-014** — ADR-011 earmarked for the audit framework, ADR-012 taken by Cowork second free-form tier, ADR-013 taken by autonomy axis relocation; floor bumped 2026-05-23 per ADR-013 §Consequences/Neutral + T6).
- **Hook portability across environments:** Lesson #3 A3 documents the workaround; durable fix deferred (would require hook regeneration policy).
- **Convention extraction:** `git.md` and `hardware.md` may still be extracted from CLAUDE.md (low priority).

## Active TODOs

- [ ] **PLAN-0005 deferred-foundational revisit register** — six Phase 2 "simple thing first" simplifications are production-foundational and must be picked back up at the right batch boundary, not silently forgotten (full table: PLAN-0005 §8.1): rule-based recommender → **ADR-010 ACCEPTED (2026-05-22) → PLAN-0006 next** (LLM reasoning hook); minimal approval gate → **ADR-011+** (audit framework — trigger: first design-partner data / PDPA review); no mapping layer → **dbt/SQLMesh** (trigger: first non-synthetic source); hand-authored ORM → **"ORM emitter"** Rule-of-Three candidate (trigger: 3rd vertical / DDL↔ORM parity-test drift); base Postgres only → **PLAN-002** (pgvector/AGE — trigger: semantic + graph features); explicit registry → **ADR-006 D3 L2** (trigger: vertical #2/#3 or `new-vertical` generator). *(per Cray note 2026-05-21)*
- [ ] **Phase-enum amendment** — add `consultation` (or equivalent Q&A-round value) to canonical Phase enum (Q15 of `2026-05-20-0245-code-plan003-pre-draft-consultation-reply.md`); requires touching `tools/handoffs/_schema.py` + `docs/conventions/handoff-frontmatter-schema.md` + validator tests; PLAN-004 Phase B adjacent. *(Deferred per R-9, 2026-05-20)*
- [ ] **Cleanup stale `ontology/README.md`** — 2026-05-05 PLAN-001 artifact; ontology directory canon now lives at `verticals/<name>/ontology/<name>_v0.yaml` per ADR-006 D1 / ADR-008 D5; superseded by PLAN-003. *(Deferred per R-9 cohort, 2026-05-20)*
- [ ] **PLAN-004 Phase B/C — DEFERRED (backlog, post-PLAN-003):** validator-scope exclusion (`README.md` / `_rename-map.md`, manifest §4.2/§6.1) + Cat G `references_*` autofix + Phase C handoff dashboard + OQ-2 systemic candidate (effective-vs-authored `status:` / archival flag so dead handoffs don't surface as actionable in the dashboard) + **validator warning-swallow bug** — `tools/handoffs/_schema.py` `_build()` (lines ~302–306) returns `Frontmatter` and discards its local `errors` list when no hard error exists, so `_check_unknown()` WARNING-severity findings (e.g. unknown field `brief-number`) are unreachable on otherwise-valid files; fix to surface warnings + add a regression test *(found 2026-05-22 dog-fooding the 4 Cowork LLM-hook handoffs; Cray routed → Phase B)*
- [ ] **ADR-NN (TBD, ≥ ADR-014) + PLAN-002** — Custom Postgres image with extensions (ADR-011 earmarked for the audit framework, ADR-012 taken, ADR-013 taken by autonomy axis relocation; floor bumped from ≥0013 to ≥0014 on 2026-05-23 per ADR-013 T6)
- [ ] Set up self-hosted GitHub Actions runner on MS-S1 MAX
- [ ] Extract `docs/conventions/git.md` from CLAUDE.md (low priority)
- [ ] Extract `docs/conventions/hardware.md` from CLAUDE.md (low priority)

## Next Steps

1. **PLAN-0005 §8.1 revisit register** — remaining deferred-foundational simplifications at their batch boundaries (audit framework → ADR-011+, mapping layer, ORM emitter, base-Postgres → PLAN-002 (≥ADR-014), registry discovery).
2. **Partner-trial readiness gaps** — `docs/research/private/2026-05-22-partner-trial-readiness-gaps.md` awaits a dedicated Cray discussion.
3. **Deferred (backlog)** — PLAN-004 Phase B (validator-scope exclusion; Cat G `references_*` autofix; validator warning-swallow bug) + Phase C (handoff dashboard); PLAN-002 custom Postgres image (≥ADR-014).
4. **Ongoing** — Continue exercising the file-based handoff mechanism (Chat ↔ Code ↔ Cowork) across batches.

## Update Workflow

This file is updated when:
- A commit changes project state significantly
- A new ADR/PLAN is minted or completed
- Active priorities shift
- A batch closes (sync `last_updated` + `current_batch` + `head_commit` + `recent_commits` frontmatter)
- A session closes (sync all frontmatter fields; archive batch history if needed)

**Update mechanism (locked per STATUS staleness batch 2026-05-18, Hybrid A+B short-term, C long-term):**

- **Per closeout (Option A + Q1(b) discipline):** Closeout drafter includes the line "STATUS.md updated: yes / no / N/A" in their closeout. If `yes`, the closeout's commit batch should include a dedicated `docs(status): …` housekeeping commit (Q3(b/c) pattern) bumping at minimum the `last_updated` and `head_commit` frontmatter fields.
- **Per batch boundary (Option B full body):** Full body refresh (Current Focus + Recent Decisions + Active TODOs + Next Steps) at batch close, alongside the frontmatter bump.
- **Per session boundary:** Full body + frontmatter sync; consider archive of prior session's batch history.
- **Future (Option C, PLAN-004 Phase A):** Validator will flag stale STATUS.md by comparing **frontmatter `last_updated` field** against newest closeout's `created` timestamp (NOT file mtime — mtime is defeated by side-effect commits, e.g. `c85a595` 2026-05-16 normalization sweep that touched STATUS.md body without bumping `last_updated`).

**Q4 `head_commit` semantics (codified 2026-05-18, locked Cray ratification of midflight `2026-05-18-1049` §4 + closeout `2026-05-18-1202` §6.2):**

- `head_commit` = short SHA of the newest **substantive** commit on
  `origin/main` that STATUS.md content reflects.
- **Excluded from `head_commit`:** `docs(status): …` housekeeping
  commits. These commits encode no new repo state — they ARE the
  STATUS.md freshness marker. Including them in `head_commit` creates
  a self-defeat where every housekeeping commit makes STATUS.md appear
  "fresh" to Q4 detection regardless of substantive backlog.
- **Substantive (included in `head_commit`):** everything else —
  `docs(lessons):`, `docs(adr):`, `docs(runbook):`, `feat:`, `fix:`,
  `chore:` (when changing meaningful state), `refactor:`, `test:`, etc.
  Any commit type that changes durable repo content updates
  `head_commit` at the next STATUS.md edit.
- **Reader recipe (returning after a pause):**

  ```bash
  # Newest substantive commit on origin/main (the value head_commit should hold)
  git log -1 --format=%h --invert-grep --grep='^docs(status):' origin/main

  # Compare to STATUS.md head_commit field
  grep -E '^head_commit:' docs/STATUS.md
  ```

  If the two differ → STATUS.md content is stale relative to substantive
  repo state. If they match → STATUS.md is fresh.

- **Writer rule (at each STATUS.md update):** Set `head_commit` to the
  output of `git log -1 --format=%h --invert-grep --grep='^docs(status):' origin/main`
  *after* the substantive commits of the current batch land but *before*
  any `docs(status):` housekeeping commit (or, if the STATUS.md edit
  itself is in a substantive commit like `docs(lessons):`, set
  `head_commit` to that substantive commit's own SHA — which becomes
  knowable only post-commit, so the writer typically updates
  `head_commit` to the *most-recent prior substantive commit* and lets
  the next batch's first edit catch up).
- **Two failure modes this rule closes:**
  1. **mtime trap** (closeout `2026-05-18-1202` §2): side-effect commits
     that touch STATUS.md body without bumping `last_updated` (e.g.
     `c85a595` 2026-05-16 normalization sweep) leave the file mtime-fresh
     but semantically stale. A SHA in `head_commit` cannot drift this way.
  2. **Housekeeping self-defeat** (closeout `2026-05-18-1202` §6.2 +
     midflight `2026-05-18-1049` §4): if `head_commit` = own SHA, every
     `docs(status):` commit makes Q4 say "fresh" regardless of
     substantive backlog. Excluding `^docs(status):` from the comparison
     baseline closes this loophole.

Manually edited until Option C lands.
