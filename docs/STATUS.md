## Current Focus

> **Sessions 153 + 154 + 155, 2026-07-20 (head_commit `a53c6ed` → `25b31e2`) —
> the demo-beat runbook staged (#822), a strategy read that CUT the tempting
> part (s154, zero commits), the operator confidence badge REMOVED from
> both cards that carried it (#823), and the late-s155 PLAN-0084 arc: filed
> (#825) → all 5 SDs Cray-resolved (#826) → BUILT end-to-end (#827) —
> map↔monitor run linkage + opt-in seed rotation + the SD-F Fastenal-adapter
> swap.** **(s153) Two docs PRs, no code.** **#821
> (`0248ec1` → merge `b45f5c4`, `docs(status)`)** was a housekeeping prune:
> the "Standard partner-intake form" Active TODO CLOSED (the deliverable
> exists and is canonical at `docs/conventions/partner-intake-form.md:8`; its
> per-vertical generalization is deferred to Rule of Three **BY DESIGN, not
> incomplete**), plus the stale `ADR-011+` / `PLAN-002 (>=ADR-014)` pointers
> dropped from Next Steps 1 and 3 — Next Steps had been **contradicting Active
> TODOs two sections up** (both were already corrected at s141). It
> deliberately did NOT bump session/head_commit/recent_commits (pure prune, Q4
> semantics), which is why s152 stayed the last real reconcile. **#822
> (`90a2afb` → merge `d8057fb`, `docs(runbook)`)** is the SUBSTANTIVE one and
> had never been reflected in STATUS until now: `docs/runbooks/run-oct-demo.md`
> §3c stages the **config-pin fail-closed refusal as a deliberate demo beat
> (Beat 06)** per PLAN-0047 Step 6 — the refusal is the product, so it gets
> rehearsed, not hidden. Both PRs sat blocked mid-session on a GitHub-Actions
> outage and landed when CI recovered (~09:34 +07).
> **(s154) ZERO repo commits — strategic analysis only.** Cray brought the
> Cerebras enterprise-knowledge-base article and asked whether vero-lite should
> adopt that approach to grow beyond governance into org-wide monitoring +
> prediction + warning-with-alternatives. Code read **ADR-0032 first** (the §2
> mandated pre-strategic read), then ran 4 read-only specialists in parallel,
> all grounded `file:line` against code. Verdicts: (1) predict+warn+alternatives
> is **NOT a new direction** — it is OCT feature 3 / Shape-1, passing the D6 fit
> filter IF prediction stays **deterministic**; (2) a KB over vero-lite's OWN
> governed artifacts is **D3 Shape-2 fuel verbatim** → pilot-gated by OQ-1; (3)
> org-wide Slack/wiki ingestion is the only genuinely new part **and the part to
> CUT** (fails D6 ~0/4, hits the named refused archetype, DPO-veto surface); (4)
> the surviving reframe = **"governed retrieval over the decision record — an
> answer an auditor accepts"**. The live blog URL 500'd everywhere, so Cray
> saved the page manually and Code re-verified the digest-based analysis against
> the real article: **all 4 verdicts `confirmed — prior intact`**, deltas were
> refinements only. Highest-value delta: the blog gives its authn/authz/audit
> layer ONE bullet and zero design detail — **retrieval quality is the published
> commodity; governance OF retrieval is the uncovered lane.** Artifacts are
> gitignored under `docs/research/private/cerebras/`.
> **(s155, this session) `next-work-analyst` + the badge removal (#823,
> `fix(ui)`).** A full 4-agent Explore fan-out ranked post-rehearsal work; Cray
> commissioned item #1. **#823 (`f09cc99` + `ffb251b` → merge `4edfa3f`) removed
> the operator-facing confidence badge from BOTH cards that carried it**,
> executing the already-ratified demo-card trust shape
> (`docs/plans/done/0035-governed-action-verify-reshape-build.md:591-602`,
> Cray-approved s74, re-recorded s142, cited by ADR-0030: "No operator-facing
> confidence badge"). `f09cc99` removed the hardcoded "Confidence 86%" + meter
> from the story-mode scene-2 governed-action card and the same number from the
> proposal-card meta; **`ffb251b` removed the same badge from the View-B
> "Anomaly & Decision" card, where it was driven by a LIVE `rec.confidence` —

> recommendation card the decision actually names. **KEPT by design:** confidence
> inside the reasoning trace (trace-only is the point), the fault-mode `AI 0.41
> ↓ → rule fail-safe` badge (it narrates the reroute MECHANISM, not a self-graded

> half; orphaned `.gc-conf-top` / `.dc-conf-top` / `.dc-conf-val` rules removed;

> Files: `view-story.js`, `view-anomaly.js`, `story.css`, `views.css`,

> accuracy (97.5% vs 97.5–100%) at **3–15x lower latency** — the moat claim was
> already relocated OFF raw accuracy ONTO the governance layer; **(b)** "the
> actions router is fully governed" is an **overstatement** — `append_audit` is
> called once in a failure-alert helper, approve/execute never call it, and that
> router's own GET endpoints are as ungoverned as `/query`; **(c)** the
> "ADR-0031 tripwire" cited for a learned forecaster is the **wrong ADR** —
> ADR-0031's tripwires are eval/open-StepKind/untyped/enum-widening, while the
> real determinism line is **ADR-0019:50-57 + ADR-010 IN-3**, and a deterministic
> trend projection sits on the **PERMITTED** side so long as it stays advisory;

> _Older content rotates out of this file per the **STATUS.md Rotation Policy (R1-R7)** in [`docs/runbooks/memory-architecture.md`](runbooks/memory-architecture.md) (Lesson #23): Current Focus keeps the 4 newest sessions (<=8 blocks); Recent Decisions keeps the last 10 rows. Rotated blocks/rows live in [`docs/status-archive/`](status-archive/) and git history (Tier 3). Layout — **two separate chains, both with letters ascending with time and the base holding the recent window**: the rotation archive `2026-h1b` → `c` → `d` → `e` → `f` → `2026-h1-status.md`, and the Current-Focus-only `2026-h1b` → `c` → `2026-h1-current-focus.md`. Rotations append to the two bases. **Grep the directory, not a filename** — the chain is one corpus and which file holds a given block is an artifact of where the ~192 KB R4 bar happened to fall. _[Chain created 2026-07-17 (s144): the single `2026-h1-status.md` had reached 592,577 B, 2.3x R4's cap, and the new guard (#789) forced the split.]_

## Prior focus (archived)

PLAN-003 Phase 1 (ontology engine + 5 emitters), PLAN-0005 Phase 2
(OCT engine runtime layer), PLAN-0006 (LLM reasoning hook),
PLAN-0007 Phase 1 (harness autonomy layer — deterministic floor),
and **PLAN-0008 Phase 2 (harness autonomy layer — probabilistic /
classifier-mediated engine on top of Phase 1)** are all **merged and
moved to `docs/plans/done/`**. The Cowork-as-Tier-1 trial that ran as
the test-bed across the earlier batches **concluded** — ratified
permanently by **ADR-009** (Cowork = merged Tier 0 + Tier 1 workspace;
commits stay Code-exclusive). PLAN-004 Phase A (handoff frontmatter
schema + tooling) also landed; Phase B/C remain deferred (backlog).
Full detail lives in `docs/plans/done/`, the Recent Decisions table
below, and git history.

An exposure breach above the account's own `credit_limit_thb` routes the full governed AT-2 spine (per-entity band → `rule_gate` KYC/overdue-AR/blacklist → `doa_tier` approval + SoD); the ฿550,000 breach routes mid-ladder.** The 3rd signature REUSES the money `doa_tier` ladder UNCHANGED (no new gate kind / authority quantity) — only `ComplianceCriterion += {kyc, overdue_ar, blacklist}` grows; engine diff bounded to that additive `spec.py` block (the `Person` promotion was PLAN-0082's, already on main). **ADR-0025 D7 re-eval PERFORMED at N=3** (Cray-ratified: generator stays deferred, marker re-arms N=4).

## In-Flight Discussions

- **ADR-012 guarded trial (Cowork second free-form tier):** Accepted 2026-05-22 (`7916b39`) as a guarded trial — Cowork gains Tier-1b (repo-grounded free-form / thinking-partner / informal code review) alongside Chat (repo-blind blue-sky). Regression triggers R-FF1..R-FF4 are the exit criteria; under observation across the next sessions.
- **ADR-0020 partner-sim guarded trial (synthetic design-partner simulation venue):** Accepted 2026-06-13; guarded trial (parallel to ADR-012) — verdict **continue-with-adjustments**. Run 1 (energy, s93) + Run 2 (supply-chain, s94) both COMPLETE, S-checks all PASS against pre-committed oracles, no R-PS trigger fired; C-1..C-3 CONFIRMED → **no open partner-sim debt**. ADR-011 audit stays gated on a REAL partner conversation (R3: SYNTHETIC provenance INFORMS but never TRIGGERS it). Full record: `docs/adr/0020-*.md` + the gitignored run packages `docs/research/private/2026-07-02-partnersim-run{1,2}-*.md`. _(Full prior narrative — the ~8 schema-mismatch findings, both run details, cross-run synthesis — archived to `docs/status-archive/` at the s117 deep-rotate.)_
- **Partner-trial-readiness gaps:** `docs/research/private/2026-05-22-partner-trial-readiness-gaps.md` — Cowork's engine→design-partner-trial gap analysis (gap groups A–E; recommended T0–T4 sequence). Informational; awaits a dedicated Cray roadmap discussion. Key fork: NL-query-first ("wow demo on synthetic") vs real-data-first ("show me MY data").
- **Procurement vertical — GO + SHIPPED (PLAN-0036 Fastenal, Stage 1):** 4th vertical greenlit (s75); PLAN-0036 drafted + merged Draft (#412, `7a7c036`; SD-1…SD-5 confirm-all). Demo target = Fastenal Thailand (auto-parts / EEC); **hero** = asset-failure → governed emergency sourcing, **calm-path** = low-stock reorder. Stage 1 = a PLAN-only pure-config plugin on the ADR-016 engine (zero `services/` core edit; CQ-1 / ADR-0023). **Pitch** = asset-ontology-triggered governed sourcing (native ontology ADR-008 + engine ADR-016), NOT the commoditized "governed"/"cross-vertical" claims. Full record: `docs/plans/0036-*.md` + the s72 de-risk dossier `docs/research/private/2026-06-22-procurement-*.md` (5 files: spec-expressiveness, GTM, asset-aware incumbent scan, AI-sourcing teardown, platform-incumbent deepdive). _(Full prior narrative archived to `docs/status-archive/` at the s117 deep-rotate.)_
- **PLAN-002 (Database setup):** Custom Postgres image with pgvector + Apache AGE + pg_trgm. Not yet drafted. **Note:** ADR-005 was originally reserved for this decision (PLAN-001 line 9 forward-reference); ADR-005 was reused for the strategic pivot, so the Postgres-image ADR needs a fresh number (**≥ ADR-014** — ADR-011 earmarked for the audit framework, ADR-012 taken by Cowork second free-form tier, ADR-013 taken by autonomy axis relocation; floor bumped 2026-05-23 per ADR-013 §Consequences/Neutral + T6).
- **Hook portability across environments:** Lesson #3 A3 documents the workaround; durable fix deferred (would require hook regeneration policy).
- **Convention extraction:** `git.md` and `hardware.md` may still be extracted from CLAUDE.md (low priority).

## Active TODOs

- [ ] **AT-2 stale `N=2` / `N=3` signature counts — doc drift across three artifacts (surfaced s155).** The live value is **`N=3`, with the ADR-0025 D7 generator marker RE-ARMING at `N=4`** (Cray-ratified at the s151 PLAN-0081 re-eval). Stale counts survive in: **(1)** `services/engine/procedures/spec.py` comments — **ungated, fix freely**; **(2) ADR-0025 D7** and **(3) ADR-0032** — both **G1-gated Accepted-body edits**, so they route via `plan-drafter`, never a direct Code write. Only `tests/services/engine/procedures/test_at2_signature_retrigger.py` carries the correct `_RETRIGGER_N = 4`, so the *test* is the source of truth and nothing turns RED on the prose drift. _[Irony worth preserving: **ADR-0032's own Positive-consequences section claims it makes exactly this stale-N-count error class harder to reintroduce** — and it now carries that very drift.]_ *(s155; blocks nothing, but every stale count is a wrong premise for the next AT-2 scoping call.)*
- [ ] **PLAN-0075 follow-ons — homed by PLAN-0076 (`Status: Tracking`, filed #752, s133): T1, the ADR-0031 D3 gate-plugin seam (F-FACTORY), is now the ONLY open deferral — Step T2's F-PIN remainder CLOSED s143 (#784, PLAN-0078 PR-5).** _[T2 closed ≠ F-PIN closed: **F-PIN itself stays OPEN** (`docs/plans/done/0078-transform-seed-migration.md` L-4 — PLAN-0078 closed s144 COMPLETE at 12/12 and archived, but **no artifact records F-PIN closed**) — only T2's remainder fold-in closed, so **PLAN-0076 does NOT archive** and its guard stays ARMED.]_ A guardrail against the ADR-0031 OQ-4 deferral-rot precedent (s133 4-specialist panel); PLAN-0075 itself is **COMPLETE — all 13 ACs — and CLOSED → `docs/plans/done/0075-*.md`**. Full detail: `docs/plans/0076-at2-followon-tracking-gate-seam-and-derivation-pin.md` — F-FACTORY `:61-127`. **Guard:** PLAN-0076's AC-6 presence guard-test (`tests/services/engine/procedures/test_at2_followon_tracking_guard.py`) turns the build RED on a premature archive-to-`done/` or a pruned STATUS pointer ("location≠tripwire; failing tests are the real anti-rot"). *(PLAN-0075 = #749/#751 → `done/`; PLAN-0076 = #752, `Status: Tracking`; T2 closed by #784.)*
- [ ] **Rock 3 — Box-4 economics + the procedure→ontology data-binding gap (O-2) — open ONLY for the O-2 residue; every other leg is DONE + archived.** **Closed:** Q3 ontology data-binding (PLAN-0046) · the Q4 generic query executor (PLAN-0048) · the Q4 join/projection grammar (ADR-016 Q4 amendment #659 + PLAN-0061) · the per-vertical seed migration (PLAN-0062) · the per-entity `threshold_field` band arc (PLAN-0066/0067/0068/0070) · **Box-4 BUILT (PLAN-0071, AC-5 GREEN at N=4) + SURFACED IN THE HERO UI (PLAN-0073)** — all → `docs/plans/done/`. **The one OPEN residue:** procurement's `intake` is declared-expressible ✔ under shadow parity, but **production execution stays the co-existing `_SeedQuery` ✖ for derived fields** — `docs/plans/done/0062-per-vertical-seed-migration.md:348`, the SD-C co-exist decision `:54-60`, `:291-295`. **Now homed by the transform arc:** **PLAN-0077** (transform grammar, COMPLETE → `done/0077-*.md`) + **PLAN-0078** (**COMPLETE at 12/12 ACs, CLOSED s144 #786 → `done/0078-*.md`** — the Step-7 closeout swept AC-5/AC-6 and archived it; do NOT re-open) — the fold-in is named at `docs/plans/0076-*.md:170-174`, what stays seed-side at `docs/plans/done/0078-transform-seed-migration.md:150-155`. *(s84 strategy discussion; the Box-4 leg is DONE — the residue is the O-2 data-binding leg only.)*
- [ ] **Bounded/incremental chain verification (PLAN-0063 SD-4 follow-up, s118).** `GET /audit/verify` walks the WHOLE chain O(n) on demand — accepted at pilot scale, documented in the endpoint docstring (`services/api/routers/audit.py:13-16`). Future work = a checkpointed head / verify-since-anchor design; anchor storage ≈ external anchoring — **do not build without re-reading the tripwire: `docs/plans/done/0063-audit-chain-verification-surface.md:564` + `services/api/routers/audit.py:19`.** _[Corrected s141: this item used to say "ADR-011 tripwire territory" — **ADR-011 does not exist** (`docs/adr/` jumps 0010 → 0012; it is an earmark only); the tripwire text lives at the two anchors above.]_ *(s118; #688/#690)*
- [ ] **DEFERRED: a monotonic `sequence` column on `step_results` — the ROOT fix for `load_run`'s wall-clock ordering.** Needs a DB migration → its own PLAN (PLAN-0062-independent); none drafted. `ORDER BY created_at` is **unchanged by design**, so **the deferral STANDS**; both surviving orderings are **DISPLAY-ONLY**, so not urgent. Full detail — ROOT-vs-guard, why it is tolerable, the static AST guard holding the line: the module docstring of `tests/services/db/test_load_run_ordering_guard.py`, pointed to from both code sites. *(rehomed s142; s117; #678/#680/#684)*

## Next Steps

1. **PLAN-0005 §8.1 revisit register** — remaining deferred-foundational simplifications at their batch boundaries (audit framework, mapping layer, ORM emitter, base-Postgres → the custom-Postgres image, registry discovery). _[Corrected s153: dropped the stale "→ ADR-011+" and "→ PLAN-002 (≥ADR-014)" pointers — **ADR-011 does not exist** (earmark only, per the Active TODO above) and **PLAN-002 was never drafted** with its ADR floor moot; each item's corrected status lives in Active TODOs.]_
2. **Partner-trial readiness gaps** — `docs/research/private/2026-05-22-partner-trial-readiness-gaps.md` awaits a dedicated Cray discussion.
3. **Deferred (backlog)** — PLAN-004 Phase C only (optional polish: handoff dashboard / references-graph / unified export — Phase B complete s35, warning-swallow fixed #312); the custom Postgres image (needs a fresh ADR number + a PLAN — neither drafted; see the Active TODO for the corrected framing).
4. **Ongoing** — Continue exercising the file-based handoff mechanism (Chat ↔ Code ↔ Cowork) across batches.

## Update Workflow

This file is updated when:
- A commit changes project state significantly
- A new ADR/PLAN is minted or completed
- Active priorities shift
- A batch closes (sync `last_updated` + `current_batch` + `head_commit` + `recent_commits` frontmatter)
- A session closes (sync all frontmatter fields; archive batch history if needed)

**Update mechanism (locked per STATUS staleness batch 2026-05-18, Hybrid A+B short-term, C long-term):**

- **Per closeout (Option A + Q1(b) discipline):** Closeout drafter includes the line "STATUS.md updated: yes / no / N/A" in their closeout. If `yes`, the closeout's commit batch should include a dedicated `docs(status): …` housekeeping commit (Q3(b/c) pattern) bumping at minimum the `last_updated` and `head_commit` frontmatter fields.
- **Per batch boundary (Option B full body):** Full body refresh (Current Focus + Recent Decisions + Active TODOs + Next Steps) at batch close, alongside the frontmatter bump.
- **Per session boundary:** Full body + frontmatter sync; consider archive of prior session's batch history.
- **Future (Option C, PLAN-004 Phase A):** Validator will flag stale STATUS.md by comparing **frontmatter `last_updated` field** against newest closeout's `created` timestamp (NOT file mtime — mtime is defeated by side-effect commits, e.g. `c85a595` 2026-05-16 normalization sweep that touched STATUS.md body without bumping `last_updated`).

**Q4 `head_commit` semantics (codified 2026-05-18, locked Cray ratification of midflight `2026-05-18-1049` §4 + closeout `2026-05-18-1202` §6.2):**

- `head_commit` = short SHA of the newest **substantive** commit on
  `origin/main` that STATUS.md content reflects.
- **Excluded from `head_commit`:** `docs(status): …` housekeeping
  commits. These commits encode no new repo state — they ARE the
  STATUS.md freshness marker. Including them in `head_commit` creates
  a self-defeat where every housekeeping commit makes STATUS.md appear
  "fresh" to Q4 detection regardless of substantive backlog.
- **Substantive (included in `head_commit`):** everything else —
  `docs(lessons):`, `docs(adr):`, `docs(runbook):`, `feat:`, `fix:`,
  `chore:` (when changing meaningful state), `refactor:`, `test:`, etc.
  Any commit type that changes durable repo content updates
  `head_commit` at the next STATUS.md edit.
- **Reader recipe (returning after a pause):**

  ```bash
  # Newest substantive commit on origin/main (the value head_commit should hold)
  git log -1 --format=%h --invert-grep --grep='^docs(status):' origin/main

  # Compare to STATUS.md head_commit field
  grep -E '^head_commit:' docs/STATUS.md
  ```

  If the two differ → STATUS.md content is stale relative to substantive
  repo state. If they match → STATUS.md is fresh.

- **Writer rule (at each STATUS.md update):** Set `head_commit` to the
  output of `git log -1 --format=%h --invert-grep --grep='^docs(status):' origin/main`
  *after* the substantive commits of the current batch land but *before*
  any `docs(status):` housekeeping commit (or, if the STATUS.md edit
  itself is in a substantive commit like `docs(lessons):`, set
  `head_commit` to that substantive commit's own SHA — which becomes
  knowable only post-commit, so the writer typically updates
  `head_commit` to the *most-recent prior substantive commit* and lets
  the next batch's first edit catch up).
- **Two failure modes this rule closes:**
  1. **mtime trap** (closeout `2026-05-18-1202` §2): side-effect commits
     that touch STATUS.md body without bumping `last_updated` (e.g.
     `c85a595` 2026-05-16 normalization sweep) leave the file mtime-fresh
     but semantically stale. A SHA in `head_commit` cannot drift this way.
  2. **Housekeeping self-defeat** (closeout `2026-05-18-1202` §6.2 +
     midflight `2026-05-18-1049` §4): if `head_commit` = own SHA, every
     `docs(status):` commit makes Q4 say "fresh" regardless of
     substantive backlog. Excluding `^docs(status):` from the comparison
     baseline closes this loophole.

Manually edited until Option C lands.
