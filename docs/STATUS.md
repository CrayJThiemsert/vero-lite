current_batch: "Phase 1 hero-demo MERGED (#492/#493). Building Phase-2 `scored_rule` per-kind executor (PLAN-0044 A1b Step 5) on `feat/a1b-scored-rule`: deterministic supplier selection that emits the selected quote's `amount` onto the threaded entity so the `approve` doa_tier resolves — closing the §3 ฿-threading finding (the shipped `source` `ActionStepExecutor` returns action envelopes, dropping the input entity's amount → doa_tier fails closed at approve). Then C-3 live runner on `feat/hero-demo-v1-live`."

## Current Focus

> **Session 91 (head_commit `788994d`) — HERO-DEMO PHASE 1 (the offline
> foundation) SHIPPED + MERGED (#492 session-90 reconcile / #493 Phase-1
> foundation) → the "governed → run → ฿" demo path has a working offline
> spine.** MILESTONE, not closure — Phase 1 is the offline foundation only;
> the SD-1 live layer (C-full) is still WIP on `feat/hero-demo-v1-live` and
> **A1b is NOT complete** (AC-9 + PLAN-0044 Steps 2/4/5 remain). **#493
> shipped four commits (PLAN-0045):** **Step 1 (`85eafaa` — C1
> `FastenalCsvAdapter`):** a CSV-backed hero-demo `DataAdapter` in `verticals/`
> only, **zero `services/` core edit**. **Step 1b (`6fb7b2b`):** the
> governance-moment audit capture — `resolve_doa_tier` + `check_principal_sod`
> pulled from the **real engine** (not a re-implementation). **Step 3
> (`b76c080` — B1):** the ฿-impact ledger + the `/demo/hero/{governance,impact}`
> **derived API views** behind **4 demo guards**. **Step 2 (`f310778`):** the
> governance-moment render screen `view-hero.js` (render tab **G**).
> **Verification (attributed to the session-90 handoff evidence, NOT re-run
> this session — CLAUDE.md §6):** the offline gate was green (~2005 tests) and
> the change was verified live on the `oct-demo` preview — all 4 cards, both
> `governed_decision` joins JOIN, the contrast case = MANAGER, the ฿-ledger
> ฿9.76M → ฿1.65M. **§3 ฿-threading finding (the next move's driver):** the
> shipped `source` `ActionStepExecutor` returns action envelopes and **drops
> the input entity's amount**, so the `approve` `doa_tier` fails CLOSED at
> approve (no threaded ฿). **NEXT (Phase 2):** build **PLAN-0044 A1b Step 5**
> (`GovernanceActionExecutor._scored_rule` branch) on `feat/a1b-scored-rule` —
> score candidate quotes deterministically (LLM summarises only), select the
> winner, emit `amount`+`currency` onto the threaded entity so the `approve`
> `doa_tier` resolves; offline gate = **AC-7** (deterministic pick) + a

> **Session 89 (head_commit `f5527d9`) — A1b STEPS 3 + 6 (the rest of the
> demo-critical path) SHIPPED + MERGED (#488 `doa_tier` / #489

> DEMO-CRITICAL PATH IS COMPLETE ON MAIN.** MILESTONE, not closure — **A1b is
> NOT complete** (AC-9 + Steps 2/4/5 remain). With **Step 1 (#486, the live
> fail-closed SoD gate)**, all three structured fields the hero render joins on
> are now on main. **Step 3 (#488, `34be3a5` — AC-5):** a deterministic

> → a `Person`, and **fails CLOSED on a currency mismatch (OQ-4)**; the
> **SD-1 = (a) `GovernanceActionExecutor` wrapper** dispatches on
> `governance_content.kind` **without a new `StepKind`**. **Step 6 (#489,
> `f5527d9` — AC-8):** the typed, minimal **`governed_decision`

> DB emission** (the real hero gate emits
> `{kind:'sod', id:'approve+intake', principal_id:'appr-director'}`), **full
> suite 1973 passed / 5 skipped**. **Axis-B goal-gate: J1 PASS + J2 PASS**
> (independent goal-evaluator, creator≠critic intact, both steps). **AC-9
> DEFERRAL (surfaced for Cray, NOT silently applied):** the procurement

## Prior focus (archived)

PLAN-003 Phase 1 (ontology engine + 5 emitters), PLAN-0005 Phase 2
(OCT engine runtime layer), PLAN-0006 (LLM reasoning hook),
PLAN-0007 Phase 1 (harness autonomy layer — deterministic floor),
and **PLAN-0008 Phase 2 (harness autonomy layer — probabilistic /
classifier-mediated engine on top of Phase 1)** are all **merged and
moved to `docs/plans/done/`**. The Cowork-as-Tier-1 trial that ran as
the test-bed across the earlier batches **concluded** — ratified
permanently by **ADR-009** (Cowork = merged Tier 0 + Tier 1 workspace;
commits stay Code-exclusive). PLAN-004 Phase A (handoff frontmatter
schema + tooling) also landed; Phase B/C remain deferred (backlog).

## In-Flight Discussions

- **ADR-012 guarded trial (Cowork second free-form tier):** Accepted 2026-05-22 (`7916b39`) as a guarded trial — Cowork gains Tier-1b (repo-grounded free-form / thinking-partner / informal code review) alongside Chat (repo-blind blue-sky). Regression triggers R-FF1..R-FF4 are the exit criteria; under observation across the next sessions.
- **ADR-0020 partner-sim guarded trial (synthetic design-partner simulation venue):** Accepted 2026-06-13 (ratified `4d1347b`, #302; committed Proposed `e25281d`, #297 + instruction `e387a63`, #298 + R1 errata `655344d`, #300) — guarded trial under observation (parallel to ADR-012). A specialist Cowork project role-plays a Thai operator and emits a "partner profile package" to rehearse the intake+PDPA pipeline before a real partner; venue OUTSIDE the governance tiers (no commits / no repo mount / enters via Code receive). Three BINDING anti-circularity rules R1/R2/R3 (R3 SYNTHETIC provenance → never trips PLAN-0005 §8.1 / ADR-011 first-real-data trigger). All four venue SDs + dispatch-SD-1 ratified per Cowork rec (SD-1 N=3; SD-2 one-project-per-business-type; SD-3 size/region/maturity enums w/ energy·mid·th-regional·mixed-legacy default; SD-4 "what we refused to share" now required). D4 guarded-trial mirrors ADR-012 D5; regression triggers R-PS1..R-PS4 are the exit criteria; run 1 = energy operator (ADR-005 primary). **Now live-able: Cray launches run-1 (paste the R1-clean seed NOT the one-pager); ADR-011 audit framework stays gated on a partner conversation — the synthetic run INFORMS but never TRIGGERS it.**
- **Partner-trial-readiness gaps:** `docs/research/private/2026-05-22-partner-trial-readiness-gaps.md` — Cowork's engine→design-partner-trial gap analysis (gap groups A–E; recommended T0–T4 sequence). Informational; awaits a dedicated Cray roadmap discussion. Key fork: NL-query-first ("wow demo on synthetic") vs real-data-first ("show me MY data").
- **Procurement vertical — GO + IN MOTION: PLAN-0036 (Fastenal, Stage 1) drafted + merged Draft (#412, `7a7c036`):** **GO** — Cray greenlit the 4th vertical (Procurement) and **PLAN-0036 (Fastenal procurement vertical, Stage 1) is drafted + merged Draft** (#412, head_commit `7a7c036`; Cowork-D1 + Code-R2 + committed D2, session 75). **Cray adjudicated SD-1…SD-5 = confirm-all** (2026-06-24, as-recommended). **Demo target = Fastenal Thailand** — automotive/auto-parts in the EEC; **hero** = asset-failure → governed emergency sourcing, **calm-path** = low-stock reorder. Stage 1 = a **PLAN-only, no-ADR pure-config plugin** on the shipped ADR-016 engine, **zero `services/` core edit** (CQ-1 confirmed, ADR-0023); the **SD-4 catch** = `services/engine/procedures/spec.py` `Step = ConfigDict(extra="forbid")` → Stage-1 facet annotations are **comment-only** (a first-class `facet` field = a Stage-2 ADR-016 amendment). It is the **proving ground** for the ultimate **3-phase generative-procedure platform** (generate / run / monitor); per Rule-of-Three it builds **no generic generator** (hand-author → extract schema Stage 2 → generator Stage 3). **NEXT = a new session flips PLAN-0036 Draft → Ready for execution (SDs confirm-all) then executes Stage 1.** *Supporting de-risk dossier (Cowork, session 72, 2026-06-22, `docs/research/private/`)* — **(1)** `2026-06-22-procurement-spec-expressiveness-probe.md` (procurement is **config-layer**, **0 new core amendments**; only engine pulls are the already-deferred ADR-016 Phase 2 / Phase 4+ items); **(2)** `2026-06-22-procurement-gtm-commercial-validation.md` (wedge = ops-triggered asset-aware procurement; econ buyer = CFO/Controller, champion = ops/procurement mgr; metric = **cycle-time**; ~$40K–150K/yr; 6-wk paid pilot); **(3)** `2026-06-22-procurement-asset-aware-incumbent-scan.md` (de-risk #1 — EAM/CMMS = nearest incumbent on the *trigger* only; white space = the **triple intersection** asset-trigger × governed sourcing × cross-vertical); **(4)** `2026-06-22-ai-sourcing-competitor-teardown.md` (de-risk #2 — Verusen/Keelvar/Fairmarkit/Arkestro/… triple intersection unoccupied; defensibility on **axis (a) asset-event trigger**; watchlist: **Verusen #1**, Fairmarkit, Coupa); **(5)** `2026-06-22-platform-incumbent-deepdive.md` (de-risk #3 — Palantir/Maximo/GE Vernova/SAP = capability-yes / product-no; moat = **packaging × ICP × price** = the **"Palantir-lite"** thesis, ADR-005, **governed ≠ generated**). **Pitch:** lead with asset-ontology-triggered governed sourcing + the native ontology (ADR-008) + engine (ADR-016) combination — **NOT** "governed"/"cross-vertical" (now commoditized claims).
- **PLAN-002 (Database setup):** Custom Postgres image with pgvector + Apache AGE + pg_trgm. Not yet drafted. **Note:** ADR-005 was originally reserved for this decision (PLAN-001 line 9 forward-reference); ADR-005 was reused for the strategic pivot, so the Postgres-image ADR needs a fresh number (**≥ ADR-014** — ADR-011 earmarked for the audit framework, ADR-012 taken by Cowork second free-form tier, ADR-013 taken by autonomy axis relocation; floor bumped 2026-05-23 per ADR-013 §Consequences/Neutral + T6).
- **Hook portability across environments:** Lesson #3 A3 documents the workaround; durable fix deferred (would require hook regeneration policy).
- **Convention extraction:** `git.md` and `hardware.md` may still be extracted from CLAUDE.md (low priority).

## Active TODOs

- [x] **PLAN-0041 (classify-prompt enrichment lever — Rock 1) — COMPLETE (s87, offline gate #475/#476 + live AC-7 PASS, moat byte-identical).** The prompt-only fix for the s83 AC-B5 ~1-in-3 false-abstain: offline gate (#475 Steps 1-3 + #476 Step 4) + the Cray-gated live before/after on MS-S1 `gpt-oss:20b` (Arm A 8→11/11 all reps; Arm B 11/11 abstain; label_abstain 33/33, step_disagreement 0); the AT-2 cross-check stayed byte-identical, no schema change, no new ADR; the offline gate is the binding bar, live = confirming. PLAN `git mv` → `done/`. *(Cowork-D1 → Code-R2 → Cray-ratified → committed #461; executed Steps 1-5 Code-direct s87)*
- [ ] **Rock 2 / O-3 — AT-2 / managerial layer — ADR-0025 RATIFIED + ACCEPTED (#463, s84); next = the follow-on build PLAN.** The Box-3 "Action = contract" layer (DOA/SoD/scored-rule/compliance). **ADR-0025 (Accepted)** decided: type AT-2 content (D2 authoritative discriminated `Step.governance_content` keyed to `gate_kind`, not the facet), bypass structurally unrepresentable (D3), **close the live run-gate AT-2-blindness defect** (D5), **defer the generator** under a CI-enforced N≥2 re-trigger (D7; AT-2 = N=1). **NEXT = the follow-on build PLAN (OQ-5, separate Cowork dispatch):** type the content + the D5 gate-extension + the prose→typed migration of the existing procurement AT-2 in **ONE PR behind a green golden test** (⚠ the shipped AT-2 fails `validate_governance_complete` until typed). OQ-3 (run vs author-only) concrete v1 call lands in that PLAN. *(s84; ADR-0025; [[project_vero_ultimate_target_generative_procedures]])*
- [ ] **Rock 3 — Box-4 economics + the procedure→ontology data-binding gap (prepare-now / build-later, s84 roadmap).** (1) **Box 4 (Profit Formula):** the reasoning trace is operational, not economic — tie each action to ฿ impact (avoided outage / margin / ROI). Prepare by capturing the economic dimension as prose when hand-authoring Fastenal + proving the ฿ framing in the demo; type an economic-impact facet only after N≥3 verticals triangulate it. (2) **Q3 data-access gap:** a `query` step has no typed binding to an ontology object (today `input.from_step` is intra-step only; no read-side `Agent.allowed.object_types`) — the right design binds query steps to **ontology objects** (the mapping layer absorbs source diversity), NOT connectors-in-the-procedure. Both = generalized-schema work, post-Fastenal. *(s84 strategy discussion + the 3-layer / ontology-binding diagram)*
- [ ] **Rock 4 — Cowork deep research DELIVERED → O-sequence locked, O-1 done, O-3 Accepted (s84).** The 4-box + Palantir + agentic research landed (`docs/research/private/2026-06-28-rock4-4box-palantir-agentic-research.md`; ~48 sources, vendor-vs-independent tagged, adversarially balanced; central finding = the evidence asymmetry [bullish ROI all vendor, independent mostly skeptical]) → Cray **locked O-1 → O-3 → O-2 → O-4**. **O-1 (Box-4 ฿ pitch artifact) DONE** (conservative ฿ + impact-ledger mock; `docs/strategy/private/2026-06-28-box4-roi-spine-impact-ledger-pitch.md`). **O-3 = ADR-0025 Accepted** (see Rock 2). **Remaining:** **O-2** (economic-impact facet + Q3 ontology data-binding = Rock 3, after N≥3) · **O-4** (agent-interop North-Star, vision only). [[reference_rock4_4box_palantir_demo_research]]. *(s84 Cray ask)*
- [ ] **PLAN-0005 deferred-foundational revisit register** — six Phase 2 "simple thing first" simplifications are production-foundational and must be picked back up at the right batch boundary, not silently forgotten (full table: PLAN-0005 §8.1): rule-based recommender → **ADR-010 ACCEPTED (2026-05-22) → PLAN-0006 next** (LLM reasoning hook); minimal approval gate → **ADR-011+** (audit framework — trigger: first design-partner data / PDPA review); no mapping layer → **dbt/SQLMesh** (trigger: first non-synthetic source); hand-authored ORM → **"ORM emitter"** Rule-of-Three candidate (trigger: 3rd vertical / DDL↔ORM parity-test drift); base Postgres only → **PLAN-002** (pgvector/AGE — trigger: semantic + graph features); explicit registry → **ADR-006 D3 L2** (trigger: vertical #2/#3 or `new-vertical` generator). *(per Cray note 2026-05-21)*
- [ ] **Demo card UX — "trust shape", NO operator confidence badge (s74 design, Cray-approved).** For the next demo round's operator recommendation card: show **what / grounded-why / approve gate** + a **"show full reasoning trace" toggle** that reveals the engine-view (where the floor-vs-judge agreement lives, labelled *audit/QA — not the operator*; reuses the scene-6 why-toggle pattern). **No operator-facing confidence badge** — the floor-vs-judge `confidence_signal` (PLAN-0035 Phase 2) is an **engine-internal QA/audit signal kept trace-only (SD-3 option A)**; surfacing it as a badge mis-reads as "the action might be wrong" (it is **not** — member (b) is advisory, never changes the action). The **(B) first-class `verification` envelope field is NOT needed for the operator UI** — reconsider **only** if a future internal audit/QA dashboard wants confidence as a first-class field (trace stays sufficient otherwise). Settled via a show_widget design review (s74; Cray: "ตรงใจ ตอบโจทย์"). The reframe: users want *what was decided · is it right · why* — answered by the action + grounding (real entity, allow-listed handler, deterministic detection, human approve) + the reasoning trace, **not** a self-reported confidence number. *(Trigger: the next demo / UI round; pairs with any (B) reconsideration.)*
- [ ] **PLAN-004 Phase C — OPTIONAL POLISH (forward-declared; "may never land"):** HTML/markdown handoff dashboard under `docs/` + references-graph (mermaid dispatch chains) + `render_transcript.py` unified session export (PLAN-0004 §"Phase C"). *(Phase A + B both COMPLETE — session 35; the prior TODO's validator **warning-swallow bug was FIXED #312**, s58. Minor never-formally-scoped sub-ideas — README/`_rename-map` walk-exclusion, Cat G `references_*` autofix, OQ-2 effective-vs-authored `status:` dashboard flag — fold in only if Phase C lands. Reconciled 2026-06-16 s65 audit.)*
- [x] **A1 — verify+reshape governance demo (B-γ moat successor) — DONE (s74).** The heaviest moat-proof: prove the moat IS governance — verify an LLM step's output for semantic consistency + reshape to the next step's contract (what arm (c) structurally lacks; ADR-016 area; the B-3 REPORT forward-points to it). **Scope together with the Phase-2 governed-entity-resolution ADR** — one ADR-016-area construct, not two overlapping ADRs. **UPDATE (s71):** that consolidation is DONE — **ADR-0022 (Accepted) D3-α already houses verify+reshape as member (b)**, so A1 = a PLAN to build member (b) (like PLAN-0030 built member (a)), at most an ADR-0022 amendment if a member-(b) design fork surfaces — NOT a new ADR. A2's residual decomposition (s71) shows the concrete A1 target: the 5 correct-action "assessment-prose" cases (verify the proposal states the action, reshape from the resolved handler). Sequenced AFTER the G2 root-fix (Cray, s71). **UPDATE (s73, cont.):** advanced END-TO-END — **SD-1 adjudicated = (c) Hybrid, phased** (Cray); **Phase 1 floor SHIPPED** (#403 `1c34125` — `services/engine/action_verification.py` at the `_compose_llm_record` seam; 1629 passed/22 skipped; AC-5 wrong-handler-not-rescued + D-6 held); the **(c) hybrid governance RATIFIED** (#404 ADR-0022 amendment [member (b) = hybrid, 7 constraints, local-LLM pin, scope = mechanism-only] + PLAN-0035 revision [Phase 1/2 restructure]; #405 `3625ea4` amendment ratified, SD-A1 = (i) inline). **UPDATE (s74) — DONE:** **Phase 2 (the advisory local-LLM-judge, Steps 8–12) SHIPPED** (#407, feat `5c7c175`) on the Phase-1 floor — the advisory judge (never overrides the surfaced action, ②) + deterministic agreement (③) + `verification_mode` degradation disclosure reusing the IN-4 / OllamaUnreachable path (④), gated behind `verification_judge_enabled` default-off (①); tests fake the judge (1639 passed/22 skipped). **PLAN-0035 flipped Draft → Complete + `git mv` to `done/` (`805f5d2`) — both phases of member (b) verify+reshape now shipped, the A1 arc closed end-to-end.** *(folded from §7 handoff, s67; PLAN drafted+merged s73; Phase 1 shipped + (c) ratified s73; Phase 2 shipped + A1 closed s74)*
- [x] **A2 — equal-rubric arm-(a) re-grade — DONE (s71, #392 + `2463229`).** Committed reproducible harness `benchmarks/procedure_comparison/regrade_arm_a.py` reproduces the full §B-3 A2 table (hardened 24→33/39→39/40→40; nudged 40/40/40), all-120 sanity assert green (every recomputed full-key grade matches the stored `proposal_correct`). §B-3 enriched with the handler-verified residual decomposition: the 7 hardened-reduced aquaculture misses = **5 correct-action** (`start_emergency_aerator`, prose framed as an "assessment" omitting the verb → the prose `action_keywords` check misses it) + **2 genuine wrong-action** (`increase_water_exchange`) → true wrong-action **2/40**. Finding: arm (a) ties-or-exceeds arm (c) once the rubric + prompt confounds are removed; the 5 prose-omission cases are the A1 verify+reshape target. *(folded from §7 handoff, s67; closed s71)*
- [ ] **ORM-emitter per-vertical layout (B1-DP-1 follow-up; Cray-deferred s67).** B1 (PLAN-0031, #370) ships the ORM emitter writing energy's ORM to the **committed** `services/db/models.py` (via `code_generator._ORM_COMMITTED_DEST`) — the gitignored `verticals/<ns>/generated/` cannot host a runtime dependency. When a **2nd vertical needs its own ORM** (the Rule-of-Three trigger), decide the per-vertical layout: extend `_ORM_COMMITTED_DEST` to per-vertical committed modules **vs** un-ignore a per-vertical `generated/orm.py` (gitignore negation) + re-export. Premature to design now (one ORM today). *(Cray-deferred 2026-06-18)*
- [x] **G2 drafting-friction root-fix — PLAN-0034 FULLY COMPLETE — DONE (s72).** Step-5 prong-2 scope annotation merged (#399, `.claude/autonomy-triggers.md`; annotation `5daa0e0` / merge `0f56d24`) — Cowork-drafted (ADR-009 D1, K-1/K-2; Code declined the Stop-hook Code-direct override, applied byte-identical edits, committed). PLAN-0034 flipped **Ready for execution → Complete** + `git mv docs/plans/0034-*.md → docs/plans/done/` (`72f0deb`). SD-3 = (a) PLAN-only (no ADR amendment). The only residual is the **optional, non-blocking** Cray-gated live gold re-score (prong-1 behavioral proof, host-state — **NOT** an acceptance gate; the offline gate, green at #397, is the sole acceptance condition). Parked s63; hit AGAIN s66 + s67 + s68; DRAFTED s71 (#394); ratified all four SDs = (a) + core-implemented s71 (#396/#397). *(folded from §7 handoff, s67; s68 instance + classifier prong; drafted s71; ratified+implemented s71; closed s72)*
- [x] **Promote the "proceed vs Cowork-dispatch-file" routing standard — DONE (s68).** Promoted into **CLAUDE.md §6** ("Routing: proceed vs Cowork-dispatch", #376 / commit `1963282`) — **home changed from the tentative `docs/conventions/` to CLAUDE.md per Cray's 2026-06-19 decision** (strong binding). Cowork-drafted (ADR-009 D1), Code R2-reviewed + committed (D2). Private Auto-Memory slimmed to a pointer (SD-C); parked G2 root-fix preserved separately (line above, SD-D). *(folded from §7 handoff, s67; closed s68)*
- [ ] **ADR-NN (TBD, ≥ ADR-014) + PLAN-002** — Custom Postgres image with extensions (ADR-011 earmarked for the audit framework, ADR-012 taken, ADR-013 taken by autonomy axis relocation; floor bumped from ≥0013 to ≥0014 on 2026-05-23 per ADR-013 T6)
- [ ] Set up self-hosted GitHub Actions runner on MS-S1 MAX
- [ ] Extract `docs/conventions/git.md` from CLAUDE.md (low priority)
- [ ] Extract `docs/conventions/hardware.md` from CLAUDE.md (low priority)

## Next Steps

1. **PLAN-0005 §8.1 revisit register** — remaining deferred-foundational simplifications at their batch boundaries (audit framework → ADR-011+, mapping layer, ORM emitter, base-Postgres → PLAN-002 (≥ADR-014), registry discovery).
2. **Partner-trial readiness gaps** — `docs/research/private/2026-05-22-partner-trial-readiness-gaps.md` awaits a dedicated Cray discussion.
3. **Deferred (backlog)** — PLAN-004 Phase C only (optional polish: handoff dashboard / references-graph / unified export — Phase B complete s35, warning-swallow fixed #312); PLAN-002 custom Postgres image (≥ADR-014).
4. **Ongoing** — Continue exercising the file-based handoff mechanism (Chat ↔ Code ↔ Cowork) across batches.

## Update Workflow

This file is updated when:
- A commit changes project state significantly
- A new ADR/PLAN is minted or completed
- Active priorities shift
- A batch closes (sync `last_updated` + `current_batch` + `head_commit` + `recent_commits` frontmatter)
- A session closes (sync all frontmatter fields; archive batch history if needed)

**Update mechanism (locked per STATUS staleness batch 2026-05-18, Hybrid A+B short-term, C long-term):**

- **Per closeout (Option A + Q1(b) discipline):** Closeout drafter includes the line "STATUS.md updated: yes / no / N/A" in their closeout. If `yes`, the closeout's commit batch should include a dedicated `docs(status): …` housekeeping commit (Q3(b/c) pattern) bumping at minimum the `last_updated` and `head_commit` frontmatter fields.
- **Per batch boundary (Option B full body):** Full body refresh (Current Focus + Recent Decisions + Active TODOs + Next Steps) at batch close, alongside the frontmatter bump.
- **Per session boundary:** Full body + frontmatter sync; consider archive of prior session's batch history.
- **Future (Option C, PLAN-004 Phase A):** Validator will flag stale STATUS.md by comparing **frontmatter `last_updated` field** against newest closeout's `created` timestamp (NOT file mtime — mtime is defeated by side-effect commits, e.g. `c85a595` 2026-05-16 normalization sweep that touched STATUS.md body without bumping `last_updated`).

**Q4 `head_commit` semantics (codified 2026-05-18, locked Cray ratification of midflight `2026-05-18-1049` §4 + closeout `2026-05-18-1202` §6.2):**

- `head_commit` = short SHA of the newest **substantive** commit on
  `origin/main` that STATUS.md content reflects.
- **Excluded from `head_commit`:** `docs(status): …` housekeeping
  commits. These commits encode no new repo state — they ARE the
  STATUS.md freshness marker. Including them in `head_commit` creates
  a self-defeat where every housekeeping commit makes STATUS.md appear
  "fresh" to Q4 detection regardless of substantive backlog.
- **Substantive (included in `head_commit`):** everything else —
  `docs(lessons):`, `docs(adr):`, `docs(runbook):`, `feat:`, `fix:`,
  `chore:` (when changing meaningful state), `refactor:`, `test:`, etc.
  Any commit type that changes durable repo content updates
  `head_commit` at the next STATUS.md edit.
- **Reader recipe (returning after a pause):**

  ```bash
  # Newest substantive commit on origin/main (the value head_commit should hold)
  git log -1 --format=%h --invert-grep --grep='^docs(status):' origin/main

  # Compare to STATUS.md head_commit field
  grep -E '^head_commit:' docs/STATUS.md
  ```

  If the two differ → STATUS.md content is stale relative to substantive
  repo state. If they match → STATUS.md is fresh.

- **Writer rule (at each STATUS.md update):** Set `head_commit` to the
  output of `git log -1 --format=%h --invert-grep --grep='^docs(status):' origin/main`
  *after* the substantive commits of the current batch land but *before*
  any `docs(status):` housekeeping commit (or, if the STATUS.md edit
  itself is in a substantive commit like `docs(lessons):`, set
  `head_commit` to that substantive commit's own SHA — which becomes
  knowable only post-commit, so the writer typically updates
  `head_commit` to the *most-recent prior substantive commit* and lets
  the next batch's first edit catch up).
- **Two failure modes this rule closes:**
  1. **mtime trap** (closeout `2026-05-18-1202` §2): side-effect commits
     that touch STATUS.md body without bumping `last_updated` (e.g.
     `c85a595` 2026-05-16 normalization sweep) leave the file mtime-fresh
     but semantically stale. A SHA in `head_commit` cannot drift this way.
  2. **Housekeeping self-defeat** (closeout `2026-05-18-1202` §6.2 +
     midflight `2026-05-18-1049` §4): if `head_commit` = own SHA, every
     `docs(status):` commit makes Q4 say "fresh" regardless of
     substantive backlog. Excluding `^docs(status):` from the comparison
     baseline closes this loophole.

Manually edited until Option C lands.
