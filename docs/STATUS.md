## Current Focus

> **Session 55 (current) — PLAN-0022 Phase 2 SHIPPED (#267, head_commit
> `6870f87`, `feat(engine):`; merge `9072fda`) — the session's SECOND impl
> merge: the deterministic `evaluate` executor + the `watch → gated` routing
> (ADR-0019) are LIVE.** **Phase 2a (SD-6, the evaluate executor):** NEW
> `services/engine/procedures/evaluate_step.py` — an engine-owned judge
> computing `breach / watch / ok` from the Step-authored band via
> `classify_verdict`, **no LLM call** — the ADR-0019 determinism invariant
> holds by construction. **Phase 2b (SD-1=a, watch→gated):** the aquaculture
> `watch` set now routes to a gated `increase_water_exchange` proposal
> `escalate_watch`, replacing the bare visual-check `human_task`; the
> existing `resolve_gated_step` / suspend / resume machinery is reused
> verbatim. **AC-8 named test landed** — escalation byte-for-byte identical
> under confidence 0.05 vs 0.99 (trigger = the engine watch band, never
> `confidence`; ADR-010 IN-3) — and **AC-9 held** (breach path + reject =
> continue+record proven on both gates). Full suite **1459 passed** (+14);
> ruff + mypy clean. **NEXT = Phase 3, the only remaining phase:** the
> escalation-correctness scoring lane (Step 5 — scores "escalated
> correctly" vs "should have acted" vs "should have stayed silent" on its
> own watch-tier lane), **B-6 ring-fenced: the scoring methodology must be
> Cray-ratified BEFORE any scored benchmark run** — Code drafts/surfaces
> the methodology for ratification, runs nothing scored. After Phase 3,
> PLAN-0022 archives to done/. Held items carry unchanged (nemotron MXFP4
> warm-cycle hold; bridge-resilience option B parked). *Rotation note:* per
> Cray (2026-06-11) the five session-51 CF blocks rotate at the NEXT
> reconcile; this pass added no new block (Phase 2 extends this block), so
> they are kept one more pass.
>
> *Earlier this session — Phase 1 SHIPPED (#265, `a68a114`, `feat(engine):`;
> merge `6b1bdd5`): the benchmark grader's α probe TIERED + the `Step`
> band/tiers config surface (Phase 0 = ADR-0019, #263, prior session).*
> **Step 1 (grader tiering, SD-4=a):**
> `Expected.valid_handlers` → `canonical_handler` + `acceptable_handlers`;
> dispositions are now `canonical / acceptable / forbidden-or-other`; all
> datasets migrated. Acceptable sets are grounded in PLAN-0020 REPORT
> evidence — supply_chain `[inspect]`, aquaculture
> `[increase_water_exchange]`, energy none (no recorded benign divergence).
> **Step 3 (config surface, SD-5=a):** the `Step` spec gains optional
> `threshold` / `direction` / `watch_margin` + `tiers`, and the NEW
> engine-owned `classify_verdict` (`services/engine/procedures/verdict.py`)
> is the single shared watch-band definition — `grader.classify_disposition`
> now DELEGATES to it (watch-band math defined once, per the ratified
> § Execution Order); aquaculture `procedures.yaml` carries the worked
> example. Full suite **1445 passed**; **AC-9 byte-for-byte back-compat
> held**. (The Phase-2 items formerly listed as NEXT here shipped later
> this session — superseded by the lead of this block.)

> **Session 54 — PLAN-0022 "tiered decision routing" landed as

> tiered-handler-grading follow-up is now a committed plan.** Cowork drafted it

> `services/`** (benchmark-only), so a deterministic `evaluate` executor is a real
> **prerequisite** for `watch→gated` wiring; **FP-1/SD-7** — aquaculture
> `procedures.yaml` routes `verdict: watch → human_task` (a bare visual check),
> **not** silence, so the change is an *upgrade* (bare "go look" → a `gated`

## Prior focus (archived)

PLAN-003 Phase 1 (ontology engine + 5 emitters), PLAN-0005 Phase 2
(OCT engine runtime layer), PLAN-0006 (LLM reasoning hook),
PLAN-0007 Phase 1 (harness autonomy layer — deterministic floor),
and **PLAN-0008 Phase 2 (harness autonomy layer — probabilistic /
classifier-mediated engine on top of Phase 1)** are all **merged and
moved to `docs/plans/done/`**. The Cowork-as-Tier-1 trial that ran as
the test-bed across the earlier batches **concluded** — ratified
permanently by **ADR-009** (Cowork = merged Tier 0 + Tier 1 workspace;
commits stay Code-exclusive). PLAN-004 Phase A (handoff frontmatter
schema + tooling) also landed; Phase B/C remain deferred (backlog).
Full detail lives in `docs/plans/done/`, the Recent Decisions table
below, and git history.

## Recent Decisions (last 10)

| Date | Decision | Reference |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 2026-06-11 | **ADR-0019 (`watch → gated`-proposal routing) ACCEPTED + merged (#263, `137766c`, session 54)** — PLAN-0022 **Phase 0** governance gate (CLAUDE.md §8; merges before the impl PR). Cray chose **OQ-1 form (b)** = a follow-on ADR over an in-place ADR-016 amendment. Sanctions routing the deterministic `watch` set → a `gated` `action` proposal (LLM proposes → human decides via `resolve_gated_step`); **extends ADR-016 D3** — no primitive / auto-gated / ceiling / allowlist change; trigger = engine verdict, never `confidence` (ADR-010 IN-3). **Authored by Cowork** — the G1/G2 PreToolUse gates correctly blocked Code's *direct* ADR Write/Edit (ADR-009 D1: Cowork authors, Code commits); Code R2-verified verbatim + committed. Includes an ADR-016 forward pointer + the Morning-Pond Step 4 row (`human_task` → gated proposal, SD-1=a). *(A transient classifier-bridge timeout first fail-closed the gate; diagnosed + healthy.)* | `137766c` (#263) / `docs/adr/0019-watch-gated-proposal-routing.md` + `docs/adr/0016-*` |
| 2026-06-11 | **PLAN-0022 (tiered decision routing) RATIFIED Draft → Ready for execution (#261, `46061b7`, session 54)** — Cowork-drafted (ADR-009 D1, #259); Code R2-reviewed, re-verifying the two load-bearing fact-pack catches vs HEAD (**FP-2/SD-6:** no deterministic `evaluate` executor in `services/engine/procedures/` — only `ActionStepExecutor`; a real prerequisite for `watch→gated`; **FP-1/SD-7:** aquaculture `procedures.yaml` routes `watch→human_task`, an *upgrade* target not silence). Cray accepted **SD-1..SD-7 per recommendation** (SD-1=a gated replaces human_task; SD-2=a deterministic watch band only, no ADR-010 reopen; SD-4=a reuse `forbidden_keywords`; SD-5=a fields on the `Step`; SD-6=a evaluate executor in the impl PR) + **S-1 keep ammonia**. Added **§ Execution Order**: Phase 0 ADR-016 D3 amendment first (CLAUDE.md §8) → Phase 1 grader taxonomy ∥ config (define once) → Phase 2 `evaluate` executor → `watch→gated` → Phase 3 escalation scoring. Trigger = engine watch band, never `confidence` (ADR-010 IN-3). Impl = later separate PR. Also received (gitignored research): 3 Build-Vertical narratives + the gpt-oss rubric R1–R6 | `46061b7` (#261) / `docs/plans/0022-tiered-decision-routing.md` |
| 2026-06-11 | **PLAN-0020 (Procedure-path tuning) COMPLETE + archived to done/ (#251–#256, `a6125c1`, session 53)** — the PLAN-0019 B-6 ring-fence follow-up. All `--dump-json`-VERIFIED on `gpt-oss:20b`/MS-S1: the Phase-1 aqua prompt nudge (PR #232, prev. UNMEASURED) worked dramatically — overall β `85.8%→100%`, aqua β `60%→100%`, overall α `70%→100%` (supply α `32.5%→100%`: model now picks `hold` not `inspect`). Latency lever: new `reasoning_mode=skip` (drop call-1 reasoning) cuts p95 `31.80s→21.62s` UNDER the 30s bar at **zero β cost** (`think_off` = dead lever). **SD-1** (widen supply-α) authorized at ratify but **SKIPPED at Step 9** — nudge made the divergence moot (0 `inspect`); anti-moving-target honored, no grader change.

## In-Flight Discussions

- **ADR-012 guarded trial (Cowork second free-form tier):** Accepted 2026-05-22 (`7916b39`) as a guarded trial — Cowork gains Tier-1b (repo-grounded free-form / thinking-partner / informal code review) alongside Chat (repo-blind blue-sky). Regression triggers R-FF1..R-FF4 are the exit criteria; under observation across the next sessions.
- **Partner-trial-readiness gaps:** `docs/research/private/2026-05-22-partner-trial-readiness-gaps.md` — Cowork's engine→design-partner-trial gap analysis (gap groups A–E; recommended T0–T4 sequence). Informational; awaits a dedicated Cray roadmap discussion. Key fork: NL-query-first ("wow demo on synthetic") vs real-data-first ("show me MY data").
- **PLAN-002 (Database setup):** Custom Postgres image with pgvector + Apache AGE + pg_trgm. Not yet drafted. **Note:** ADR-005 was originally reserved for this decision (PLAN-001 line 9 forward-reference); ADR-005 was reused for the strategic pivot, so the Postgres-image ADR needs a fresh number (**≥ ADR-014** — ADR-011 earmarked for the audit framework, ADR-012 taken by Cowork second free-form tier, ADR-013 taken by autonomy axis relocation; floor bumped 2026-05-23 per ADR-013 §Consequences/Neutral + T6).
- **Hook portability across environments:** Lesson #3 A3 documents the workaround; durable fix deferred (would require hook regeneration policy).
- **Convention extraction:** `git.md` and `hardware.md` may still be extracted from CLAUDE.md (low priority).

## Active TODOs

- [ ] **PLAN-0005 deferred-foundational revisit register** — six Phase 2 "simple thing first" simplifications are production-foundational and must be picked back up at the right batch boundary, not silently forgotten (full table: PLAN-0005 §8.1): rule-based recommender → **ADR-010 ACCEPTED (2026-05-22) → PLAN-0006 next** (LLM reasoning hook); minimal approval gate → **ADR-011+** (audit framework — trigger: first design-partner data / PDPA review); no mapping layer → **dbt/SQLMesh** (trigger: first non-synthetic source); hand-authored ORM → **"ORM emitter"** Rule-of-Three candidate (trigger: 3rd vertical / DDL↔ORM parity-test drift); base Postgres only → **PLAN-002** (pgvector/AGE — trigger: semantic + graph features); explicit registry → **ADR-006 D3 L2** (trigger: vertical #2/#3 or `new-vertical` generator). *(per Cray note 2026-05-21)*
- [ ] **Phase-enum amendment** — add `consultation` (or equivalent Q&A-round value) to canonical Phase enum (Q15 of `2026-05-20-0245-code-plan003-pre-draft-consultation-reply.md`); requires touching `tools/handoffs/_schema.py` + `docs/conventions/handoff-frontmatter-schema.md` + validator tests; PLAN-004 Phase B adjacent. *(Deferred per R-9, 2026-05-20)*
- [ ] **Cleanup stale `ontology/README.md`** — 2026-05-05 PLAN-001 artifact; ontology directory canon now lives at `verticals/<name>/ontology/<name>_v0.yaml` per ADR-006 D1 / ADR-008 D5; superseded by PLAN-003. *(Deferred per R-9 cohort, 2026-05-20)*
- [ ] **PLAN-004 Phase B/C — DEFERRED (backlog, post-PLAN-003):** validator-scope exclusion (`README.md` / `_rename-map.md`, manifest §4.2/§6.1) + Cat G `references_*` autofix + Phase C handoff dashboard + OQ-2 systemic candidate (effective-vs-authored `status:` / archival flag so dead handoffs don't surface as actionable in the dashboard) + **validator warning-swallow bug** — `tools/handoffs/_schema.py` `_build()` (lines ~302–306) returns `Frontmatter` and discards its local `errors` list when no hard error exists, so `_check_unknown()` WARNING-severity findings (e.g. unknown field `brief-number`) are unreachable on otherwise-valid files; fix to surface warnings + add a regression test *(found 2026-05-22 dog-fooding the 4 Cowork LLM-hook handoffs; Cray routed → Phase B)*
- [ ] **ADR-NN (TBD, ≥ ADR-014) + PLAN-002** — Custom Postgres image with extensions (ADR-011 earmarked for the audit framework, ADR-012 taken, ADR-013 taken by autonomy axis relocation; floor bumped from ≥0013 to ≥0014 on 2026-05-23 per ADR-013 T6)
- [ ] Set up self-hosted GitHub Actions runner on MS-S1 MAX
- [ ] Extract `docs/conventions/git.md` from CLAUDE.md (low priority)
- [ ] Extract `docs/conventions/hardware.md` from CLAUDE.md (low priority)

## Next Steps

1. **PLAN-0005 §8.1 revisit register** — remaining deferred-foundational simplifications at their batch boundaries (audit framework → ADR-011+, mapping layer, ORM emitter, base-Postgres → PLAN-002 (≥ADR-014), registry discovery).
2. **Partner-trial readiness gaps** — `docs/research/private/2026-05-22-partner-trial-readiness-gaps.md` awaits a dedicated Cray discussion.
3. **Deferred (backlog)** — PLAN-004 Phase B (validator-scope exclusion; Cat G `references_*` autofix; validator warning-swallow bug) + Phase C (handoff dashboard); PLAN-002 custom Postgres image (≥ADR-014).
4. **Ongoing** — Continue exercising the file-based handoff mechanism (Chat ↔ Code ↔ Cowork) across batches.

## Update Workflow

This file is updated when:
- A commit changes project state significantly
- A new ADR/PLAN is minted or completed
- Active priorities shift
- A batch closes (sync `last_updated` + `current_batch` + `head_commit` + `recent_commits` frontmatter)
- A session closes (sync all frontmatter fields; archive batch history if needed)

**Update mechanism (locked per STATUS staleness batch 2026-05-18, Hybrid A+B short-term, C long-term):**

- **Per closeout (Option A + Q1(b) discipline):** Closeout drafter includes the line "STATUS.md updated: yes / no / N/A" in their closeout. If `yes`, the closeout's commit batch should include a dedicated `docs(status): …` housekeeping commit (Q3(b/c) pattern) bumping at minimum the `last_updated` and `head_commit` frontmatter fields.
- **Per batch boundary (Option B full body):** Full body refresh (Current Focus + Recent Decisions + Active TODOs + Next Steps) at batch close, alongside the frontmatter bump.
- **Per session boundary:** Full body + frontmatter sync; consider archive of prior session's batch history.
- **Future (Option C, PLAN-004 Phase A):** Validator will flag stale STATUS.md by comparing **frontmatter `last_updated` field** against newest closeout's `created` timestamp (NOT file mtime — mtime is defeated by side-effect commits, e.g. `c85a595` 2026-05-16 normalization sweep that touched STATUS.md body without bumping `last_updated`).

**Q4 `head_commit` semantics (codified 2026-05-18, locked Cray ratification of midflight `2026-05-18-1049` §4 + closeout `2026-05-18-1202` §6.2):**

- `head_commit` = short SHA of the newest **substantive** commit on
  `origin/main` that STATUS.md content reflects.
- **Excluded from `head_commit`:** `docs(status): …` housekeeping
  commits. These commits encode no new repo state — they ARE the
  STATUS.md freshness marker. Including them in `head_commit` creates
  a self-defeat where every housekeeping commit makes STATUS.md appear
  "fresh" to Q4 detection regardless of substantive backlog.
- **Substantive (included in `head_commit`):** everything else —
  `docs(lessons):`, `docs(adr):`, `docs(runbook):`, `feat:`, `fix:`,
  `chore:` (when changing meaningful state), `refactor:`, `test:`, etc.
  Any commit type that changes durable repo content updates
  `head_commit` at the next STATUS.md edit.
- **Reader recipe (returning after a pause):**

  ```bash
  # Newest substantive commit on origin/main (the value head_commit should hold)
  git log -1 --format=%h --invert-grep --grep='^docs(status):' origin/main

  # Compare to STATUS.md head_commit field
  grep -E '^head_commit:' docs/STATUS.md
  ```

  If the two differ → STATUS.md content is stale relative to substantive
  repo state. If they match → STATUS.md is fresh.

- **Writer rule (at each STATUS.md update):** Set `head_commit` to the
  output of `git log -1 --format=%h --invert-grep --grep='^docs(status):' origin/main`
  *after* the substantive commits of the current batch land but *before*
  any `docs(status):` housekeeping commit (or, if the STATUS.md edit
  itself is in a substantive commit like `docs(lessons):`, set
  `head_commit` to that substantive commit's own SHA — which becomes
  knowable only post-commit, so the writer typically updates
  `head_commit` to the *most-recent prior substantive commit* and lets
  the next batch's first edit catch up).
- **Two failure modes this rule closes:**
  1. **mtime trap** (closeout `2026-05-18-1202` §2): side-effect commits
     that touch STATUS.md body without bumping `last_updated` (e.g.
     `c85a595` 2026-05-16 normalization sweep) leave the file mtime-fresh
     but semantically stale. A SHA in `head_commit` cannot drift this way.
  2. **Housekeeping self-defeat** (closeout `2026-05-18-1202` §6.2 +
     midflight `2026-05-18-1049` §4): if `head_commit` = own SHA, every
     `docs(status):` commit makes Q4 say "fresh" regardless of
     substantive backlog. Excluding `^docs(status):` from the comparison
     baseline closes this loophole.

Manually edited until Option C lands.
