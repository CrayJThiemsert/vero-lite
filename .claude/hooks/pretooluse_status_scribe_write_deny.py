"""PreToolUse hook — restrict ``status-scribe`` subagent writes to ``docs/STATUS.md``.

Subagent-scoped hook reached via ``pretooluse_subagent_write_dispatch.py``
(registered in ``.claude/settings.json`` for ``Write|Edit``), which routes on
the payload's ``agent_type``. The frontmatter route this originally used was
measured **dead** in session 272 (Lesson #0057). Mirrors the H2
write-path allowlist pattern established by
``pretooluse_plan_subagent_write_deny.py`` (PLAN-0009 Step 1b §5), narrowed to
the single file ``status-scribe`` is allowed to touch.

Allowed write/edit target (exactly one path):

* ``docs/STATUS.md``

Everything else is denied. Like its ``plan-drafter`` sibling and per ADR-013
D2 the hook is **fail-closed**: malformed stdin and malformed ``tool_input``
deny the call rather than passing through. ``status-scribe`` reconciles the
single volatile state file; the autonomy-governance write-path boundary must
default to deny when the harness contract is violated.

Rationale for a single-file allowlist (not a ``docs/`` prefix): STATUS
reconciliation is the only artifact this subagent authors. Archival
(``git mv`` to ``done/``), ADR/PLAN drafting (``plan-drafter``), and every
*commit* (Code via PR per CLAUDE.md §7 / ADR-009 D2) stay off this surface by
construction.

Bypass-immunity: the hook fires regardless of ``permissionMode`` (including
``bypassPermissions``).

This hook intentionally does **not** inspect ``agent_id`` / ``agent_type``
itself. 🔴 **Corrected s275 (`was an error`):** scoping does *not* come from
the frontmatter wiring. Measured session 272 (Lesson #0057): a subagent's
frontmatter ``hooks:`` block never fires in this harness. The block in the
agent file is well-formed — ``ad47f49`` rewrote all three to the documented
nested shape, which is why the agents load at all — but it is inert. The live
route is ``pretooluse_subagent_write_dispatch.py``, registered in
``.claude/settings.json`` for ``Write|Edit``, which reads the payload's
``agent_type`` and calls this module. The identity check therefore *does*
happen, one level up; this hook is right to skip it only because the dispatcher
already made it. Remove that registration and this allowlist stops being
reached at all — a silent boundary inversion, which is why
``tests/handoffs/test_settings_hook_wiring.py`` pins it.
